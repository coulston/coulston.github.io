<h1>Overview</h1>
You have completed a simple layout of the components in your 556 timer.
A layout is never "correct" or "perfect".  While an electrically correct
layout is manditory, there is a lot of room for personal aesthetics to bias
an evaluation of a layout.  These subjective bias may come from personal
experience or lessons passed down from others.   So with experience, you
will learn that you have to bend the rules sometimes to benifit the
greater good.

Since we are building a power supply unit (PSU), you need to be comfortable 
with the theory of their operation and the practice of working with
PSUs.  The behavior of a PSU can be summarized with four variables:
<dl>
<dt>Vset</dt>
<dd>The maximum voltage you want to see across the PSU outputs.
<dt>Vout</dt>
<dd>The voltage across the PSU outputs.
<dt>Iset</dt>
<dd>The maximum current you want to see throgh the PSU outputs.
<dt>Iout</dt>
<dd>The current being delivered through the PSU outputs.
</dl>
