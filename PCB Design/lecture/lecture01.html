<h1>Overview</h1>
Welcome to the intergrated circuits and electronics (ICE) field session.
It is my hope that you find this course something like an apprenticeship
of electrical design, fabrication and assembly.  There will be lots of
hands-on work of the type that you or technicians working with you, 
required to bring products to life. 
<br><br>

You will do this by designing a PCB for a basic linear power supply.


<h2>Materials needed for the class</h2>
The Colorado School of Mines will be paying for the electrical components
needed for your power supply and 556 timer circuit.  You however, are
required to acquire some materials on your own to complete the course
work.  These include the following items.
<ul>	<li>12V center-tap positive AC/DC wall transformer,
	<li>USB thumb drive ,
	<li>Bread board,
	<li>Needle nose pliers, wire stripper.
</ul>

<h2>Weekly course structure</h2>
If you have taken Embedded Systems previously, then the lab stucture 
will be familar to you.  We will start every week's class with a brief
lecture of what is happening that week and how it fits into the overall
structure of the class. You will then break into teams of 2 and proceed
to start work on the inLab.  The inLab is designed to lead you on an
investigation of the concepts that you will need to complete that week's
assignment.  The inLab will usually have some questions that you need to
answer and turn in by noon on the day following class.  During the class
session you may be asked to demonstrate your lab assignment from the
previous week.  


<h2>Lab 1</h2>
I like to think of schematics as the language of electrical engineering.
They allow an EE to quickly describe the interconnection of circuit 
elements to perform some task.  Consequently, the first part of today's
lab asks you to look over an external document on schematics.  Even 
if you are a crusty old EE with decades of experience, please take a 
few moments to quickly work through the tutorial.  It's pretty well 
oprganized.
<br><br>

A search of "resistors" on DigiKey.com yields almost half a million 
different resistors that you can purchase.  The reason for this 
diveresity is the wide variety of roles that resistors need to serve.
The second section will introduce some of the key parameters for 
resistors, potentiometers and capacitors that you will be working
with this term.
<br><br>

Finally you will examine the humble RC series circuit and deep dive 
in the charge and discharge behavior.  This will be the launching 
point for this week's lab work.
