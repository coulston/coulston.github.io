<h3>Net review</h3>
Perform a net-by-net review of your design.  This will require a
computer running EAGLE CAD, a paper copy of your schematic, a
pencil and highlighter.  Perform the following steps to get ready
for this process.

<ul>	<li>Launch EAGLE CAD,
	<li>Open your project,
	<li>Open the schematic and layout side-by-side so that they
	occupy the entire screen,
	<li>In both the schematic and layout, click Zoom to fit, the 
	magnifying glass with a black rectangle,
	<li>In the schematic, select the information tool,
	<li>Click on a part,
	<li>The Properties pop-up for that part is highlighted in the 
	layout,
	<li>Click Ok to remove the Properties pop-up,
	<li>In the schematic click on the Name tool,
	<li>In the schematic click on a wire,
	<li>The Name pop-up for the wire (showing its name) is
	highlighted in the layout,
	<li>Click OK to remove the Name pop-up.
</ul>

Remember that a net is a named interconnection of electrical devices.
A net is a logical circuit element, meaning that we use it as a place-holder
for something real.  When you "route a net", you transform the logical
net connections into physical connections with wires.  In any first 
generation design, it is a good idea to verify that the each net is 
routed correctly.  In other words, verify that the physical wires 
corresponding to the net connected to all the intended devices.
<br><br>

To do perform the following set of stes for each net in the schematic.
<ul>	<li>Select it using the Name tool,
	<li>Write the net's name on its wire in the schematic,
	<li>If the net has a defined name, then place a check next to the
	given name,
	<li>For each device that the net (in the schematic) connects to:
	<ul>	<li>Verify that it is connected in the layout,
		<li>Highlight the schematic pin corrsponding to this
		connection.</ul>
	<li>Repeat for all the nets in the schematic.
</ul>
