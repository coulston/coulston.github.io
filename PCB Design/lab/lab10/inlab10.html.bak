In Lab 10 - Bill of Materials</center>


<h1>Objective</h1>
Create manufacturing files for fabrication of your PCB.  Have the 
Lab Instructor or Teaching Assistant sign-off each of the items
below.

<h3>Paper PCB</h3>	
You need to verify that you have used the correct footprints for
your parts.

<h3>Last minute change</h3>	
Change the DC jack footprint to:
	con-jack &rarr; JACK-PLUG &rarr;JACK-PLUG1


<h3>Common problems</h3>	
<ul>	<li><b><u>Included attribution on your PCB!!</u></b>
	<ul>	<li>Your name
		<li>Board name and revision
		<li>Date 
		<li>Optional: Your company
	</ul>
	<li>Name the test points with their signal names
	(I_out, V_out, I_set, V_set) by renaming the test point in
	your schematic,
	<li>Label the VU meter switch positions settings,
	<li>Check the invertedin and non-inverting inputs on op-amp
	IC3A in the schematic below and make <u>sure</u> that your
	schematic is the same,
	<br><img width=400 src="./img/schematic.bmp"><br><Br>
	<li>The heat-sink must be adjacent to the LT30380 metal tab.
</ul>

<h3>Pass Electrical Rule Check</h3>	
There should be not major errors or warnings left in your schematic.

<h3>Pass Design Rule Check</h3>
Download <a href="./PCBway.dru">PCBway.dru</a> into your project
directory.  In layout window, make sure that you have run the 
Ratsnet tool to flood fill with any copper pours 
<ul>	<li>Tools &rarr; DRC &hellip;
	<li>In DRC pop-up, in the File tab, click Load&hellip;
	<li>In the Load pop-up, navigate to the downloaded
		PCBway.dru file, select it, click Open
	<li>Back in the DRC pop-up, select Apply, then click Check
	<li>When all the DRC errors are cleared, you will see
	"DRC: No errors." in the lower left corner of the layout
	window.
</ul>

<h3>Generate Gerber Files</h3>
Gerber files are a hold-ver from the days when PCBs were
made by eposing photographic file to a light move by a 
2-axis machine. 

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Gerber file	<td>Name		<td>Included EAGLE layers
<tr><td>layout.out	<td>Outline file	<td>20
<tr><td>layout.sst	<td>Silk Screen Top	<td>21, 25, 27, 51
<tr><td>layout.smt	<td>Solder Mask Top	<td>29
<tr><td>layout.top	<td>Top copper		<td>1, 17, 18
<tr><td>layout.bot	<td>Bottom coppper	<td>16, 17, 18
<tr><td>layout.smb	<td>Solder mask bottom	<td>30
<tr><td>layout.drd	<td>Drill file		<td>44, 45
</table>

Before you continue, take a moment to determine the width and height
of your PCB in millimeters.  You can switch the units in EAGLE layout
by selecting View &rarr; Grid.  In the Grid pop-up select "mm" as the 
size.  Or you can just convert mils to mm, whatever you prefer.

<ul>	<li>Download <a href="./PCBway.cam">PCBway.cam</a> into your 
	project directory,
	<li>Create a folder named &lt;your last name&gt;
	<li>File &rarr; CAM Processor &hellip;
	<li>Click on the Load job file icon, select 
	Open CAM File &hellip;
	<li>In the Select CAM file pop-up, navigate to the downloaded
		PCBway.cam file, select it, click Open
	<li>Back in the CAM Processor pop-up, click Process Job,
	<li>In the Select output directory pop-up, click on the folder
	named &lt;your last name&gt;, click Select Folder,
	<li>Back in the CAM Processor pop-up, you should be
	greeted with a CAM Exporter: process complete pop-up,
	click Open folder,
	<li>Delete the CAMOutputs folder,
	<li>Open windows File Explorer,
	<li>Navigate to your &lt;your last name&gt; folder,
	<li>Right click on the folder and select Send to &rarr; 
	Compressed (zipped) folder &hellip;
</ul>

<h3>Check Gerber Files</h3>

<ul>	<li>Open the<a href="https://jlcpcb.com/quote/">jlcpcb.com</a>
	web page,
	<li>Click on the blue "Add your gerber file" button,
	<li>In the Open pop-up, navigate to your &lt;your last name&gt; 
	zipped folder,
	<li>Double click on your &lt;your last name&gt; zipped file,
	<li>The web page will show you your board,
	<li>Click on the <font color=blue><u>Gerber Viewer</u></font>
	link at the lower right of your PCB,
	<li>On the Gerber View page, you can
	<ul>	<li>Move: Left mouse, drag
		<li>Zoom: Center mouse, scroll up (or down), center mouse,
		then move
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Upload your files</h3>

Please make a directory on your Google drive called "final revision"
containing your zip file created in the previous step.  If I have 
any problems uploading the designs, I'll get your design files
from your Google drive folder.
<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Put your design files on a thumb drive and take them to the 
podium computer that the lab instructor is logged into,
<li>Make sure that the browser is pointed at: https://jlcpcb.com/quote/#/
