<h2>JST connectors</h2>
A wire harness is a collection of wires with connectors at each end.
Wire harnesses are often a secondary consideration when designing a
PCB, but in fact there is a lot to consider.
<dl>
<dt>Gender</dt> <dd>While the gender of some connectors is obvious, 
others can be confusing.  Regardless, in order to make an electrical
connection, you need a male connector plugged into its female counterpart.</dd>
<dt>Polarity</dt> <dd>When a connector can only be positioned in one 
orientation to make a connection, it is said to be polarized.  There are
a lot of good reasons for polarized connectors, but they are often a little
more expensive and less reliable than their non-polarized counterparts.
<dt>Pitch</dt> <dd>The number of contacts per inch is called the pitch.
Imperial units prevail in most circles with 0.1" being the most common.

In this section we are going to walk through how to build a simple 
4-wire harness to power your 556 timer PCB and gain access to the signals.  
There will be four main parts to our wire harness:

<ul>	<li>Wire - stranded wire is more flexible.  As a result stranded 
	wire is preferred when building a wire harness.  In order to work
	with a wire, we will need to strip the insulation off the wire.
	I purchased a pair of cheap Knipex Self Adjusting Insulation 
	Strippers and I am as happy as a clam.  Do yourself a favor and
	get some.

	<li>Crimps - these are the small metal bits that connect to the wire.
	The crimp has two sets of "wings", the larger pair at the rear of
	the crimp hold the insulation of the wire, the small pair towards
	front hold the conductive wire.

	<li>Plastic housing - this holds several crimps in place so they
	can be connected as a single unit.  The crimps have a little tab
	which locks it into place when the crimp is inserted into the 
	housing.
	<br><img width = 500 src="./img/PlasticHousing.jpg"><br><br>

</ul>

To create a harness, you will need to attach the crimp to the wire using
a crimp tool.  The crimp connector has several opening to
accommodate different gages of wire.  My crimp tool has 
three openings, one to accommodate 24-28 gauge wires, one for 22-20 gauge
and one for 20-18 gauge.  My tool is ratchet, meaning that as the handles
are squeezed together, the tool incrementally closes.  Meaning that if the
jaws are brought together to a certain distance, the jaws will remain
there until the jaws are brought all the way together or the secret
switch is pressed.  The jaws are not uniform across their width.  Close
inspection reveals that both the upper and lower jaws consist of two
plates.  These two plates form two regions across the width of the
jaws, a small side and a large side.  When the jaws are fully closed,
the small side of the jaws leave the smaller side opening smaller than
the opening left on the large side. The first image below shows the small
side of the crimp tool, while the second shows the large side.

	<br><img width = 500 src="./img/LargeSideCrimpTool.jpg"><br><br>


<ol>	<li>Strip 2-3mm of wire
	<li>Position the crimp in the crimp tool - 3 clicks is enough to 
	partially close the crimp tool and still have enough room to insert
	the crimp into the 28-24 opening.
	<br><img width = 500 src="./img/crimpStep02.jpg"><br><Br>
	<li>Insert the stripped end of the wire into the crimp tool.
	This is the msot difficult and critical step.  I've found that 
	while holding the crimp tool in my left hand, I can manuever
	my trigger finger on my left hand around and hold the female 
	portion of the crimp into the small side of the crimp tool's jaw.
	You cannot alllow any portion of the female end to get in the 
	crimp tool's jaw.  At the same time, you need to insert as much
	of the crimp as you can into the crimp tool.  



	Only when I am happy with the crimp position and my finger 
	placement, do I turn the crimp tool over to look at the large
	side of the crimp tool jaws.  I then insert the stripped end of the
	wire into the end of the crimp which is a few millimeters inside 
	the large side of the crimp tool.  You need to insert the wire so
	that the stipped wire is well into the inner wings but not into the 
	female socket on the end of the crimp.

	<li>Crimp and inspect - Once you have the crimp and wire positioned 
	do you crank down on the handles.  If you ahve done everything
	correctly you will get a sturdy crimp connection to the wire.

	<li>Insert crimped wire into plastic housing

</ol>

You can remove the crimped wire from the harness by plucking up the
barb on the plastic housing.
