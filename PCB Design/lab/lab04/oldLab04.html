The questions are:
<ol>
<li>Write three questions to ask Allen.
<li>How are you getting to Epilog?
<li>Provide a reflection on your first PCB design.

<h3>Epilog Laser Visit</h3>

Next week we will be traveling to 
<a href="https://www.epiloglaser.com"> Epilog Laser</a> 
(16371 Table Mountain Parkway, Golden CO 80403)
to talk with Allen Blaylock, lead engineer at Epilog Laser.
<br><Br>


Allen will show us the design and manufacturing capabilities of Epilog and 
answer some questions from you.  As part of your homework this week, I 
would like you to come up with three questions related to engineering a 
laser cutter/engraver.  As source material, please consult Epilog's website
to understand 

<ul>	<li>PCB Design (Tools, boards, vendors)
	<li>Supply chain (choosing, history, grey market, cost)
	<li>Manufacturing
	<li>Debugging and Design stratigies
</ul>

Epilog Laser is really engaged with Mines and more specifically the
Electrical Engineering department.  They are the primary sponsor for 
the Brown 305 lab - look at the plaque next time you enter the lab.
Epilog Laser has also provided Mines with some really nice hardware in the 
<a href="https://www.minesmakersociety.com/eds-garage">Mines Garage</a>.
I would like our visit to leave a good impression so that we can continue
this partnership in the coming years.
