In Lab 3 - EAGLE schematic and MOSFET</center>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two,
read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions
prescribed.  You do not need to document bullet items.  Make a
record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy
as your teams "inLab" assignment at the start of next weeks class.
Word process your solutions.
Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions.
Use complete English sentences when answering questions.  If the
answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an
oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the
piece of art.  Only include your answers, do not include
the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.


<h1>Objective</h1>

<h2>More schematic editing in EAGLE</h2>

Objectives
<ul>
<li>Nets, display name, air wires,
<li>The information tool,
<li>Packages,
<li>EAGLE files,
<li>ERC,
<li>Devices with multiple circuits,
</ul>


<h3>Setup lab03</h3>
I would like to you to keep a copy of the work completed so far
in lab02 and use it as a starting point for lab03.  To do this:
<ul>	<li>Create a new lab03 folder inside your lab folder
	<li>Go into the lab02 folder and select the eagle project
	file (orange "E" icon) and the lab02.sch file,
	<li>Navigate to the lab03 folder and paste,
	<li>Rename lab02.sch &rarr; lab03.sch
</ul>

Now launch EAGLE and open the lab03 project.  Everything should 
look the same as you left it in lab02.  Now let's start adding
some new elements to your schematic.

<h3>Add components</h3>
Today we will focus on adding the constant current supply that
you prototyped last week.  We will start by adding the MCP6004,
a quad operational amplifier to the schematic.  When 
the term "quad" is used to describe an operational amplifier, it
means that there are four operational amplifiers inside the single
integrated circuit package.  EAGLE can treat each one of the four
operation amplfiers like its own component on the schematic even
through they all belong on a single integrated circuit.  To see
what I mean do the following:

<ul>
	<li>Select the ADD tool from the left toolbar
	<li>Search for *MCP*, go to the "linear" library, 
	open the "MCP604" folder, and select the "MCP604SL"
	in the "SO14" package,
	<li>Your pointer will change to a operational amplifier
	symbol,
	<li>Left mouse click somewhere on the schematic,
	<li>Add five more operational amplifiers.
</ul>
You should end up with something that looks like the following.

Notice that the first four operational amplifiers that you placed all
had names "IC1*" where * was A-D.  The letter designates which operational
amplifier on the chip (shown at right) is being used.  Only the "A" 
operational amplifier has the power and ground connections.  Be careful
when moving this particular operational amplfier as you can easily 
seperate the power pins from the operational amplfier.  You should
verify that the pin numbers on the schemtic agree with the pin out of
the actual device.
