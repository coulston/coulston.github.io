<center><h1>EENG 393</h1>
In Lab 9 - Board review</center>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Review three designs, assigned to you in class, using
the file <a href="./boardReview.docx">boardReview.docx</a>.  After
reviewing a design, upload the completed word document to that 
person's Google Drive folder.


<h1>Objective</h1>
Critically examine a PCB layout and provide feedback.   Utilize feedback
on your layout to improve the design.

<h3>Parts review</h3>
Please generate a bill of materials using the schematic and check it off 
against the following table.
The following table and schematic (scroll down) should resolve any questions
that you may have about what footprint to use.  You can also look through 
your bag of parts to see what parts have been provided.

<h3>Net review</h3>
There are a variety of methods that you can employ to help ensure that
your layout will be correct.  One of these is a net-by-net review of
the schematic and layout.  The goal is to insure that every signal 
you placed on the schematic, to connect components, is connecting the 
corresponding components in the layout.
<br><Br>

Perform a net-by-net review of your design for next week.  This will require 
a computer running EAGLE CAD, a paper copy of your schematic, a
pencil and highlighter.  Perform the following steps to get ready
for this process.

<ul>	<li>Launch EAGLE CAD,
	<li>Open your project,
	<li>Open the schematic and layout side-by-side so that they
	occupy the entire screen,
	<li>In both the schematic and layout, click Zoom to fit, the 
	magnifying glass with a black rectangle,
	<li>In the schematic, select the information tool,
	<li>Click on a part,
	<li>The Properties pop-up for that part is highlighted in the 
	layout,
	<li>Click Ok to remove the Properties pop-up,
	<li>In the schematic click on the Name tool,
	<li>In the schematic click on a wire,
	<li>The Name pop-up for the wire (showing its name) is
	highlighted in the layout,
	<li>Click OK to remove the Name pop-up.
</ul>

Remember that a net is a named interconnection of electrical devices.
A net is a logical circuit element, meaning that we use it as a place-holder
for something real.  When you "route a net", you transform the logical
net connections into physical connections with wires.  In any first 
generation design, it is a good idea to verify that the each net is 
routed correctly.  In other words, verify that the physical wires 
corresponding to the net connected to all the intended devices.
<br><br>

To do perform the following set of steps for each net in the schematic.
<ul>	<li>Select it using the Name tool,
	<li>Write the net's name on its wire in the schematic,
	<li>If the net has a defined name, then place a check next to the
	given name,
	<li>For each device that the net (in the schematic) connects to:
	<ul>	<li>Verify that it is connected in the layout,
		<li>Highlight the schematic pin corresponding to this
		connection.</ul>
	<li>Repeat for all the nets in the schematic.
</ul>
