<h2>Lab 11 assignment</h2>


Create an enclosure for your PCBs. You can either 3D print an enclosure or laser cut it. 
Unfortunately, I do not have instructions for 3D printing as I am still learning how to 
work with Solidworks.  So this path will be more self-directed.  I would encourage 
everyone to 3D print because there is only 1 laser cutter on campus and there will 
be a bottleneck getting access to it.  <br><br>

I will add 3D printing helpful hints as I figure this out and get input from anyone 
who is willing to help contribute to the body of knowledge here:
<ul>
	<li>You can export a DXF file of your PCB dimension layer (layer 20) and 
	then import this into SolidWorks as an accurate mechanical reference.
	<ul>	<li>From you EAGLE layout 
		<li>Select the layer tool, Hide Layers then select layer 20, Dimension
		<li>File -> Export -> DXF
		<li>Use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga1TxaE9ck4">This YouTube Video</a>
			to import the DXF into SolidWorks.
	</ul>
</ul>

The instructions for laser cutting are contained in the InLab 11 document.<br><br>

The only laser cutter on campus is in Labriola.  To get access to the laser cutter you 
will need to sign up for Labriola InnoHub Training Portal using the Join Canvas button 
on the <a href="https://labriola.mines.edu/">Labriola home page</a>.  The laser cutting 
quiz is in the Wood Shop training area.  After 
completing the quiz you will then need to sign up for training.  Training can be done 
in teams, so you may want to coordinate a common time with some friends.<br><br>


Laser cut cardboard front and and rear panels for you power supply. Only after
you have confirmed dimensions with cardboard on your actual board
should you proceed to cut acrylic.  Note that the cardboard laser cut
template will have a lot of carbon soot that will get onto your PCB.
Choose one "sacrificial" PCB to use to test fit the carboard template -
this PCB should be kept seperate from the others and NOT be used to
solder to.
