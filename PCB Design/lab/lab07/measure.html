<ol start=20>
<li>What is the standard spacing of binding posts so that they can
accomodiate double banana plugs?

<li>Look up 4-40 and explain what the two numbers mean?

<li>What is the outside thread diameter for 4-40 in mm?

</ul>

Use the information tool to place the binding posts X mils from and edge
and seperated by the distance found above.

The distance between the positive and negative plugs should be 3/4 inch (19 mm).

The standard designation for a UTS thread is a number indicating the
nominal (major) diameter of the thread, followed by the pitch measured
in threads per inch. For diameters smaller than 1/4 inch, the diameter
is indicated by an integer number defined in the standard; for all other
diameters, the inch figure is given.
