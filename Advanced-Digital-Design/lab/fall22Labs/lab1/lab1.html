<h1>Lab 1 - Video Synchronization</h1>

In this lab, you will write a HD Video controller in VHDL and implement 
it on your FPGA development board.  You will be provided a RGB-to-HDMI 
module that will automatically format your output for the HDMI output 
port on your development board.  This HD video controller will be tasked 
to generate the display portion of an oscilloscope as shown in the
figure below.  The scope face consists of a white grid, used to 
measure the signals, two trigger markers, and the waveforms.  In
this lab the waveforms will be artificially generated by your code,
but in later labs, the waveforms will be generated by incoming
audio waveforms.

<h2>HD Video Overview</h2>
The HD Video standard is an interface protocol used to transmit 
video data to a screen.  The HD Video protocol uses a scanning method 
to project an image on the screen.  Starting in the top-left of the 
screen, the monitor will progressively move from left to right, top 
to bottom to display each pixel.  The following signals must be sent 
to a HDMI equiped monitor in order to display an image.

<ol>
<li><code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, <code>blue</code> - three 
separate 8-bit signals indicating the amount of each color 
to display in the current pixel.  These signals are sometimes 
abbreviated as RGB.</li>
<li><code>h_sync</code> - Horizontal synchronization signal that tells 
the screen to start writing pixels to the next line</li>
<li><code>v_sync</code> - Vertical synchronization signal that tells 
the screen that the current video frame is completed.  After receiving
a vertical synch signal, the screen then 
starts writing pixels to the top-left of the screen.</li>
</ol>

Both horziontal and vertical orientations contain four unique states: 
<code>front_porch</code>, <code>sync_pulse</code>, 
<code>back_porch</code>, and <code>active_video</code>.   Incoming pixel 
data (through the RGB channels) is only displayed during the active_video 
state of the synchronization signals.<br><br>

The h_cnt value will count up from 0 to 1650 at 74.25MHz. The <code>pixel_clk</code>
carries this clock signal and is generated using the video_clk module.  You should
use the h_cnt counter's value to generate the h_synch and h_active signals using
simple range comparisions.  You can generate the pixelHorz value as h_cnt minus 
the width of the front_porch + synch + back_porch in the active video area. 

<br><img src="./img/figure1.jpg" alt="Figure 1"><br><br>

<strong>Figure 1</strong>: The <code>h_sync</code> signal contains four 
states.  Pixel data is only displayed on the monitor during the 
active_video state.  During all other state, the RGB values must be 
&quot;0&quot;.<br><br>

The v_cnt value will count up from 0 to 750.  The v_cnt value is incremented
every time a row of video is drawn.  So v_cnt counts up much more slowly than
h_cnt.  You should
use the v_cnt counter's value to generate the v_synch and v_active signals using
simple range comparisions.  You can generate the pixelVert value as v_cnt minus 
the width of the front_porch + synch + back_porch in the active video area. 


<br><img src="./img/figure2.jpg" alt="Figure 2"><br><br>

<strong>Figure 2</strong>: The <code>v_sync</code> signal is similar 
to <code>h_sync</code>, but instead of counting based on 
<code>pixel_clk</code>, the states are based on the number of iterations 
of the <code>h_sync</code> signal.  Pixel data is only displayed on the 
monitor during the active_video state.  During all other state, the RGB 
values must be &quot;0&quot;.<br><br>



<h2>Architecture</h2>
The design of Lab 1 is broken down into separate modules, some of which
are provided for you and some which you will need to create.  The
interconnection of the modules is illustrated in the following schematic.
When a signal name appears just inside a box, that should should correspond
to the name of that signal in the entity description.  Please note
there are a few omissions in the diagram that you should correct
as part of your documentation (see Turn-In section).

<h2>VHDL Code</h2>
In order to get you going in this lab, some of the VHDL code has been 
provided for you. In most cases, you should refrain from changing the
modules given.  In order to get a better understanding how these modules 
interact with one another, the following section provides a schematic
and the input, output and behavior of some of the modules.

<ul>	<li><a href="./code/lab1.vhdl">lab1.vhdl</a>

</ul>

There are two modules which will constitute the majority of your work, videoSignalGenerator
and scopeFace.  The following two subsections details the behavior of these
two modules.

<h3>The videoSignalGenerator module</h3>
The videoSignalGenerator component generates the signals to sweep the 
display beam across the display from left to right, and from top to
bottom.  The scopeFace component will take the pixelHorz and pixelVert
values and determine what color pixel to place at that location.

<pre>
entity videoSignalGenerator is
    PORT(
	 clk: in  STD_LOGIC;
         resetn : in  STD_LOGIC;
         hs: out STD_LOGIC;
         vs: out STD_LOGIC;
         de: out STD_LOGIC;
         pixelHorz: out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(11 downto 0);
         pixelVert: out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(11 downto 0));
end videoSignalGenerator;
</pre>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>clk	<td>This is the 74.25Mhz videoClk generated by the video_clk component.
<tr><td>resetn	<td>This is the same active low reset signal passed into the top
			level Lab1 module.
<tr><td>hs	<td>The h_synch signal for the current row,column position.
<tr><td>vs	<td>The v_synch signal for the current row,column position.
<tr><td>de	<td>The blank signal for the current row,column position.  Its
			the logical and of the h_blank and v_blank signals.
<tr><td>pixelHorz<td>The current row on the display that needs a RGB value from this component.
<tr><td>pixelVert<td>The current column on the display that needs a RGB value from this component.
</table>


The behavior of the videoSignalGenerator component contains counters which generate:
<ul>	<li>h_cnt and v_cnt
	<li>hs and vs
	<li>pixelHorz and pixelVert
	<li>h_activeArea and v_activeArea
</ul>
 
<h3>The scopeFace module</h3>
This component takes in the horziontal and vertical pixel location from the 
videoSignalGenerator component and determines the R,G,B value of the pixel
that should be drawn at that location.

<pre>
entity scopeFace is
    PORT (
  	 clk: in  STD_LOGIC;
         resetn : in  STD_LOGIC;
         pixelHorz : in  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(11 downto 0);
         pixelVert : in  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(11 downto 0);
         triggerVolt: in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (11 downto 0);
         triggerTime: in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (11 downto 0);
         red : out  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 downto 0);
         green : out  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 downto 0);
         blue : out  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 downto 0);
         ch1: in STD_LOGIC;
         ch1Enb: in STD_LOGIC;
         ch2: in STD_LOGIC;
         ch2Enb: in STD_LOGIC);
end scopeFace;
</pre>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>clk	<td>This is the 25Mhz pixel clock generated by the DCM in 
			the video module.
<tr><td>resetn	<td>This is the same active low reset signal passed into the top level component.
<tr><td>pixelVert	<td>The current row on the display that needs a RGB value from this
				component.
<tr><td>pixelHorz	<td>The current column on the display that needs a RGB value from this
				component.
<tr><td>triggerVolt	<td>This is a 12-bit value representing the trigger

			screen show) on the vertical axis.
<tr><td>triggerTime	<td>This is a 12-bit value representing the trigger 
			time.  This value is passed to the scopeFace module
			so that a yellow arrow (see Trigger Time Marker in the
			screen show) on the horizontal axis.
<tr><td>red	<td>The 8-bit red intensity for this row,column pixel on the screen.
<tr><td>green	<td>The 8-bit green intensity for this row,column pixel on the screen.
<tr><td>blue	<td>The 8-bit blue intensity for this row,column pixel on the screen.
<tr><td>ch1	<td>This 1-bit signal causes a yellow channel 1 trace to be drawn
			on the display at the current pixel location. When this
			signal is 0, no channel 1 pixel is drawn.
<tr><td>ch1enb	<td>This 1-bit signal enable the ch1 signal to be drawn.
<tr><td>ch2	<td>This 1-bit signal causes a green channel 2 trace to be drawn
			on the display at the current pixel location. When this
			signal is 0, no channel 2 pixel is drawn.
<tr><td>ch2enb	<td>This 1-bit signal enable the ch2 signal to be drawn.
</table>

The scopeFace component takes in the current row,column coordinates of the 
display and generates the R,G,B values at that screen coordinate. For example,
if row,column = 20,20 then the R,G,B output should be 0xFF,0xFF,0xFF (white)
because the upper left corner of the O'scope grid display is white.

<h2>Required Functionality</h2>

<ol>

<li>You will be asked to show the following simulation results,
	<ul>	<li>Show a image of your simulation from 0 to 1.2us.  This should show the 
		first line of video with proper hs, h_activeArea, h_cnt and pixelHorz.
		<li>Show a image of your simulation from 0 to 550us.  This should show the 
		first 34 line of video with proper vs, v_activeArea, v_cnt and pixelVert.
		<li>Show a image of your simulation from 0 to 2ms.  This should show the 
		first non-zero RGB values being sent to the display.
	</ul>

<li>Your code must generate the thick white outline that defines the border
of the oscilloscope.  Draw grid in grey (R,G,B) = (0x40, 0x40, 0x40) so that
you have 10 horziontal and 10 vertical divisions.  Draw 4 hatch marks in grey
so they evenly split each vertical and horziontal division.  Draw the markers
as triangles in cyan (R,G,B) = (0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF).


<li>The ALINX board has four buttons that you are able to associate with
your design.  One of these buttons (PL Key 1) is dedicated to the resetn
function.  Use the remaining three keys to manipuate the Trigger Volt Mark
and the Trigger Time Mark as follows:

<ul>
<li>Pressing PL_KEY3 decreases the Trigger Volt Mark
<li>Pressing PL_KEY3 while holding PL_KEY2 increases the Trigger Volt Mark
<li>Pressing PL_KEY4 increases the Trigger Time Mark
<li>Pressing PL_KEY4 while holding PL_KEY2 decreases the Trigger Time Mark
</ul>

<li>Test the channel functions by:
<ul>
<li>Drawing the channel 1 trace (yellow) along a diagonal where (row = column).
<li>Drawing the channel 2 trace (green) along a horziontal at the same level as
the voltage trigger.
</ul>

</ol>


<h2>Simulation</h2>
You will need to run simulations to make sure that all your 
videoSignalGenerator is producing the correct waveforms.  I've 
included a testbench file and TCL setup script to help you setup
the testbench.  The images below are from my simulation output.
You signals may differ slightly in their timing and your 
videoSignalGenerator will function just fine.  The RGB signal
output really depends on your scopeFace and may differ quite
a bit from what my setup generated.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Signal		<td>Color	<td>Radix
<tr><td>clk		<td>Green	<td>binary
<tr><td>resetn		<td>Green	<td>binary
<tr><td>h_cnt		<td>Yellow	<td>unsigned
<tr><td>pixelHorz	<td>Yellow	<td>unsigned
<tr><td>h_activeArea	<td>Yellow	<td>binary
<tr><td>hs		<td>Yellow	<td>binary

<tr><td>v_cnt		<td>Yellow	<td>unsigned
<tr><td>pixelVert	<td>Yellow	<td>unsigned

To help you in debugging, I've prodvided some excerpts from my 
testbench simulation.  If you right-click on the images and
open in a new window, they will enlarge.

<h2>Connecting</h2>
Your ALINX board will need to connect to the HDMI port, the JTAG progrmming 
port and the power supply. The image below shows how I made these connections.
The reset and trigger control buttons assigned in the XDC file are also shown.
