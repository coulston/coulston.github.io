<h2>The D flip flop</h2>
Since D flip flops will be a major part of this lecture, its worth
spending a few minutes reviewing their operation.  So complete the following
timeing diagram for the output of the negative-edge triggered D flip flop with
an asynchronous active low reset line.

<br><img src="./img/lecture09-7.gif"><br><br>


Setup time, denoted Tsu, is the amount of time before the rising edge
of the clock when the data inputs must be stable.
Hold time, denoted Th, is the amount of time after the rising
edge of the clock when the data input must be stable. Finally, propagation
delay, denoted Tp, is the amount of time after the rising edge of the clock
required for the new Q value to become valid.

<h2>Finite State Machines</h2>

A finite state machine (FSM) is the most general form of a sequential circuit,
a circuit whose output is a function of the input and an internal state.  In
terms of the Figure below, this statement is reinterpreted as


<br><img src="./img/lecture09-1.gif"><br><br>

Each of the signals X, Y,Q,Z is a vector, consisting of zero or more bits.
The X signal is the input to the FSM from the system being controlled -
also referred to as the <b>status</b> of the system.
The Z signal is the output from the FSM to the system being controlled -
also referred to as the <b>control</b> to the system.
The combinational logic circuit generating Z is called the output equations
(OE). 

The state of the FSM is carried on the Q lines. Each bit of Q is
the output of a D flip flop. Thus, if Q is six bits wide, then the FSM has
six D flip flops. The Y signals are called the memory inputs; they are the
data inputs to the D flip flops. The combinational logic circuit generating
the Y signals is called the memory input equations (MIEs). In order to
improve the readability of circuit diagrams, from now on, the clock signal
will not be shown. 
<br><br>

Lets take a moment to reinterpret the statement <i>The output of a finite 
state machine is a function of the input and the internal state</i> in terms
of this figure.  You should arrive at the assignment Z = F(Q), and Q+ = G(Q,X).
While the output does not directly depend on the input, it does depend on
the state, which in turn does depend on the input.
<br><br>
With respect to this Figure, the design of a FSM requires
three questions be answered: 
<ol>	<li>What are the MIEs; 
	<li>what are the OEs; and
	<li>how many D flip flops are required? 
</ol>

These questions are answered by first understanding how to convert a word 
statement into a state diagram.  So without further ado, lets bring in the
cows.

<h2>FSM Timing</h2>
The events occurring in the FSM are referenced to the clock input of
the D flip flops inside the FSM.  The timing diagram below lists events
(numberd in circles) with respect to the clock signal being applied to
the Figure above.  The following list explains what happens at each of
the points in time in the Figure below with respect to the circuit at the
top of the page.

<dl>
<dt>Event 1</dt>
<dd> Since flip flops sample their
inputs on the positive edge of the clock, this point is the beginning of the
timing analysis.
</dd>

<dt>Event 2</dt>
<dd>The propagation delay of
the flip flops means a small delay occurs between the clock edge and the flip
flop outputs, Q, becoming valid.  This is the called the propagation delay of
the flip flop and denoted T_ff in the diagram below.
</dd>

<dt>Event 3</dt>
<dd>In order to maximize the clocking
frequency of the FSM, the new inputs, X, to the FSM should be applied at
the same moment that the flip flop outputs become valid. 

<dt>Event 4</dt>
<dd>According to Figure above, changing Q and X causes the memory inputs 
to change (the Y signal above). The delay
between the application of the new inputs to the MIE logic and Y becoming valid
is the propagation delay of the combination logic, denoted Tcombo.
</dd>

<dt>Event 5</dt>
When the Y values are valid, a small delay occurs while the flip flops 
register their new inputs, denoted Tsu. After this setup time, the FSM 
is ready for another clock edge.
</dl>

<h2>The DAISY system</h2>

Since you should have some familiarity with FSM from previous course work,
we will jump right into a moderately complex example that will server as
an important stepping-stone to an important concept covered in Lectures
10-13.  Your task in this example is to design a high-tech cow-tracking 
system for a local dairy. The system is called the Dairy Automated 
Information SYstem, or DAISY for short. <br><br>

<b>Word Statement</b> Cows have a RFID tag attached to their collars. When
the cow passes through the cattle chute on their way into the barn, a RFID
reader reads the unique ID stored on the RFID tag and logs the cow into
the barn. The RFID system outputs a single bit: a 1 means the system has
read an RFID tag and has successfully checked a cow back into the barn; a
0 means the RFID system is either still processing a tag or is not currently
reading a tag.<br><br>

In order to ensure each cow is scanned, the flow of cows into the barn is
controlled by two gates at either end of the chute. Each gate is controlled by
a single bit. To lift a gate, this input must be held at logic 1; to lower a gate,
the input must be held at a logic 0. The sequence of raising and lowering
the gates in order to control the flow of cows is illustrated in Figure 8.8.

<br><img src="./img/lecture09-2.gif"><br><br>


<dl>
<dt>Step 1</dt>
<dd>Gate1 is lifted allowing cow A to enter the chute.</dd>

<dt>Step 2</dt>
<dd>The DAISY system has detected cow A is in the chute and closes gate1.<dd>

<dt>Step 3</dt>
<dd>The cow waits in the closed off chute until the RFID reader signals 
that it has read the tag and checked in cow A. </dd>

<dt>Step 4</dt>
<dd>Gate2 is raised allowing cow A to leave.  If the cow takes more than 
30 seconds to leave, then the cow is "goosed" by a three-second burst of 
compressed air.  An air bust is repeated at 30-second intervals until the 
cow leaves the chute. At any time when the cow leaves the chute, Gate 2
is closed and the system transitions back to Step 1.
</dd>
</dl>

In order to make all this happen, the DAISY is provided with inputs and
it sends outputs to mechanical actuators as shown in the figure below.

<br><img src="./img/lecture09-3.gif"><br><br>

<h3>Inputs to DAISY</h3>

The word statement infers the existence
of three inputs. The RFID scanner sends the DAISY system a single bit
which indicates if the cow has been processed. A second input tells the
DAISY system if a cow is in the chute. The final system input comes from
a timer used to inform the DAISY system when 3 or 30 seconds have expired.
We will give each of these inputs a single letter abbreviation (shown in the
table below) to simplify construction of the state diagram describing the
FSM.  

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>RFID Scanner = r 	<td>Cow Present = c	<td>Timer Status = t
<tr><td>1 - Cow checked in	<td>1 - cow present	<td>1 - timer up
<tr><td>0 - Cow not processed	<td>0 - no cow		<td>0 - timer running
</table>

<h3>Outputs from  DAISY</h3>
The word statement infers the existence of four, separate outputs. The
gates in the DAISY system are controlled by a single bit each. Assume a
logic 1 must be continuously applied to a gate in order to keep it raised.
In order to give DAISY an accurate sense of time, the system is provided
with a single timer with two bits of input and one bit of output. To use this
timer, set the timer to either 3 or 30 seconds for a single clock cycle.
Then, the control input commanding the timer to count down is continuously 
applied. The output of the timer will equal 0 until the set time limit has 
expired at which times its output will stay at 1 until a new time interval is set.
When the electronic valve controlling the compressed air is open, air rushes 
out, goosing the cow.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Gate1		<td>Gate2	<td>Timer Control	<td>Air Valve
<tr><td>1-gate up	<td>1-gate up	<td>00 Stop timer	<td>0 closed
<tr><td>0-gate down	<td>0-gate down	<td>01 Set to 30 secs	<td>1 open
<tr><td>		<td>		<td>10 Set to 3 secs	<td>
<tr><td>		<td>		<td>11 Run timer	<td>
</table>


<h3>State Diagram</h3>
The process of creating the state diagram for the DAISY
system requires considering movement through the steps of the process 
required to get a single cow through the gated chute. Each step in this process
then becomes a state or a set of states. Each state asserts some output to
control the devices connected to the DAISY system. Below is one possible
list; other arrangements are possible.
<ol>
<li> Open gate1
<li> Wait for cow to enter chute
<li> Close gate1
<li> Wait for RFID to read cow
<li> Open gate2
<li> Wait for cow to leave
<li> If 30 seconds has transpired, then goose cow; goto Step 6
<li> Else if the cow has left, then close gate2; goto Step 1
</ol>

Note when drawing the state diagram, you want each state to represent a 
particular arrangement of the outputs (state). Each state will be put
into a circle with its name in it.  Our first step is to get the state
diagram drawn, we will concern ourselves with the main actions that need
to be performed, only after this will be focus on the specific outputs
needed to accomplish them.  The inputs are responsible for moving the FSM 
between these arrangements.  Each input is provided with an abbreviation
in order to make drawing the state diagram more manageable.  When the 
the variable, equal to logic 1, causes a transition, it is written
by itself on the arc.  When the variable, equal to 0, causes a transition,
it is written with a prime above it on the arc.

<br><img src="./img/lecture09-4.gif"><br><br>

<h3>Memory Input equations</h3>
Remember from the first figure that the memory input equations
are a function of both the current state and the input.
The memory input equations depend on the state encoding - what binary
code is assigned to each state. We will look at two dense and 
one's hot.  <br><br>


<b>Dense</b>
If you elect to use a dense encoding, you are trying to given each
state a binary representation that minimizes the number of flip-
flops.  While on the surface this seems the most logical course,
we will see that it in fact creates a number of difficulties.
For the sake of an example, lets use the state encoding given in the
table below.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>State 		<td>Code	
<tr><td>WaitEnter	<td>000
<tr><td>WaitRead	<td>001
<tr><td>Set30		<td>010
<tr><td>WaitLeave	<td>011
<tr><td>Set3		<td>100
<tr><td>Goose		<td>101
</table>

This table implies that we will have three flip flops and consequently,
3-bits for Q.  Since there are 3-bits of inputs, we have a total of 
6-bits of input into the MIE component. Thus, we will have to solve
three (one for each of the flip flop inputs) 6-input Boolean equations.
This is a massive pain so I decided to use an automated design tool,
<a href="http://www.ecs.umass.edu/ece/labs/vlsicad/ece667/links/espresso.html">espresso</a>
to help me.  Espresso is a 2-level logic minimization tool that takes
a truth table as input and produces a near optimal SOP description of the
output.<br><br>

<b>Input File to espresso</b>
<pre>
.i 6			# .i specifies the number of inputs 
.o 3			# .o specifies the number of outputs 
.ilb Q2 Q1 Q0 R C T    	# This line specifies the names of the inputs in order 
.ob  D2 D1 D0		# This line specifies the names of the outputs in order 
   			# The first six digits (before the space) correspond 
  			# to the inputs, the three after the space correspond 
   			# to the outputs, both in order specified above. 

000 -0- 000		# WaitEnter + c' => WaitEnter
000 -1- 001		# WaitEnter + c' => WaitRead

001 0-- 001		# WaitRead + R' => WaitRead
001 1-- 010		# WaitRead + R => Set30

010 --- 011		# Set30 => WaitLeave

011 -10 011		# WaitLeave + T'C => WaitLeave
011 -11 100		# WaitLeave + TC => Set3
011 -0- 000		# WaitLeave + c' => WaitEnter

100 --- 101		# Set3 => Goose

101 --0 101		# Goose + T' => Goose
101 --1 010		# Goose + T => Set30

.e	     	# Signifies the end of the file.
</pre>

<b>Output</b>
<br><img src="./img/lecture09-5.gif"><br><br>

This level of work to derrive the MIEs takes a lot of time and 
any changes mean that we will have to redo all this work.  Frankly,
this is just too much of a pain. Lets compare this against a different
encoding called one's hot.  <br><br>

<b>One's Hot</b>
A one's hot encoding requires an individual flip flop for each state.
So in our case, we will have 6 flip flops.  Each state is assigned
a flip flop, which outputs 1 when the FSM is in that state.  Thus
the term "one's hot" means that only one of the flip flops will be
hot (output of logic 1) at a time.  The table below is a one's hot
encoding for our state diagram.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>State 		<td>Code	
<tr><td>WaitEnter	<td>000001
<tr><td>WaitRead	<td>000010
<tr><td>Set30		<td>000100
<tr><td>WaitLeave	<td>001000
<tr><td>Set3		<td>010000
<tr><td>Goose		<td>100000
</table>

Using this state assignment, it is an entirely easy to determine the
memory input equations.  For each state, just ask yourself, how do
I get into that state?  The answer is that you need to start at a
state and traverse an arc.  For example, there are two ways to get
into the WaitEnter state, through WaitEnter (and no cow) or 
WaitLeave (with a cow).


<pre>
D_WaitEnter = Q_WaitEnter * c' + Q_WaitLeave * c
D_WaitRead = Q_WaitRead * r' + Q_WaitEnter * c
D_Set30	 = Q_WaitRead * r
D_WaitLeave = Q_Set30 + Q_WaitLeave * t' * c 
D_Set3 = Q_WaitLeave * t * c
D_Goose = Q_Goose * t' + Q_Set3
</pre>


<h3>Output Equations</h3>
The first step in generating the output equations is to build a
control word table - a table listing, for each state, its output.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>State 	<td>Gate1	<td>Gate2	<td>Timer	<td>Control Air
<tr><td>	<td>1-gate up	<td>1-gate up	<td>00 Stop timer<td>0 - closed
<tr><td>	<td>0-gate down	<td>0-gate down	<td>01 Set to 30 secs<td>1 - open
<tr><td>	  <td>		<td>		<td>10 Set to 3 secs	<td>
<tr><td>	  <td>		<td>		<td>11 Run timer	<td>
<tr><td>WaitEnter <td>1 	<td>0		<td>00		<td>0
<tr><td>WaitRead  <td>0		<td>0		<td>00		<td>0
<tr><td>Set30	  <td>0		<td>1		<td>01		<td>0
<tr><td>WaitLeave <td>0		<td>1		<td>00		<td>0
<tr><td>Set3	  <td>0		<td>1		<td>10		<td>0
<tr><td>Goose	  <td>0		<td>1		<td>11		<td>1
</table>

In order to generate a set of equations for these equations, we need to 
know the state coding because the OE depend on the Q's.  Lets use the
one's hot encoding.  Then we need to go down each column in the 
control word table and determine for which states the output is equal
to 1.  Then just list those states as shown in the output equations
below.

<pre>
Z_Gate1 <= Q_WaitEnter;
Z_Gate2 <= Q_Set30 + Q_WaitLeave + Q_Set3 + Q_Goose
Z_Timer_1 <= Q_Set3 + Q+Goose
Z_Timer_0 <= Q_Set30 + Q_Goose
Z_Air = Q_Goose
</pre>
