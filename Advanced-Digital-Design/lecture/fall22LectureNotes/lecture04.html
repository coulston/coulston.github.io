<h2>Sequential Elements</h2>

Goals:
<ul>	<li>basic sequential process and sensitivity list
	<li>register, counter in VHDL
	<li>Combination of sequential and combinational logic (counters)
	<li>Translate between schematic, truth table, and VHDL code
</ul>


<h2>Mod 10 counter example</h2>

<h3>Truth Table</h3>
The following state table defines a straight forward mod 10 counter, a
counter that goes from 0-9 and then wraps back around to 0.  


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>clk		<td>reset	<td>ctrl	<td>D	<td>Q+
<tr><td>0,1,falling	<td>x		<td>xx		<td>x	<td>Q
<tr><td>rising		<td>0		<td>xx		<td>x	<td>0
<tr><td>rising		<td>1		<td>00		<td>x	<td>Q
<tr><td>rising		<td>1		<td>01		<td>x	<td>Q+1 mod 10
<tr><td>rising		<td>1		<td>10		<td>D	<td>D
<tr><td>rising		<td>1		<td>11		<td>D	<td>0
</table>


<ul>
<li>The first
line tells us that the counter only changes state on a positive clock
edge (any other condition results in the next state of Q (denoted Q+)
being unchanged (equal to Q)).  
<li>The second line defines the behavior of
the reset being active low (to agree with the reset button on the 
Atlys board).  
<li>The third row tells you that the counter will hold when the 2-bit control 
is equal to 00.  
<li>The fourth row tells you that the counter will count up when the 2-bit control 
is equal to 10.  The "mod 10" means that the counter is supposed to count from
0 to 9 and then on the next count go back to 0.
<li>The fifth row tells you that the counter will load D when the 2-bit control 
is equal to 10. 
<li>The sixth row tells you that the counter will synchronously reset when the 
2-bit control is equal to 11. 
</ul>

<h3>Timing Diagram</h3>
The first activity that we will complete is to determine the timing diagram
on the first page of the handout.  The key idea to remember is that the output
of the counter does not change until a positive edge of the clock arrives.
On the first 2 clock edges, reset is equal to 0 so Q will go to 0.  After the
second clock edge the reset line is never low so the behavior of the counter is 
dictated by the last four rows of the state table.  On clock edges 3 to 30, 
ctrl is 01, so Q is incremented by 1.  Remember that the clock edge after Q=9,
Q goes back to 0.

The following timing diagram was created by the testbench for the modCounter.

<h3>Circuit Diagram</h3>
After completing the timing diagram, see if you can figure out how to construct
the counter using the arrangement of devices show in the picture below.  
<ul>
<li>You may assume that all these elements are able to handle 4-bit values, just 
make sure to draw a hash through these signals with a "4" next to it.  
<li>You should not draw additional lines in this picture, instead labeled the wires
 with names and use these names to create logical connections between signals with 
the same name.
<li>Draw a border around your circuit.  The only signals that should cross
the boundary are those which are part of the entity description.
</ul>

<h3>VHDL</h3>

As we know, the VHDL description of a circuit consists of two components,
the entity and the architecture.  The entity is pretty simple as it consists
of those signals in the state table description given at the top of this page.
All you need is to determine the direction and type.

<pre>
entity modCounter is
	PORT(	clk: in  STD_LOGIC;
		reset : in  STD_LOGIC;
		ctrl: in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(1 downto 0);
		D: in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0);
		Q: out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0));
end modCounter; 
</pre>

The VHDL code here is going to be something new.  To break it down, the code
consists of three statements; the process (lines 5-23), and the two CSAs
on lines 24 and 25.  The process realizes the circuit you completed above.

<ul>
<li>Line 7 enforces the condition on the first row of the truth table; that
Q can only change on a rising clock edge.  
<li>Line 8 enforce the condition on the second row of the truth table, that 
whenever reset =0, the Q output goes to 0.  The "others" statement is an
efficient way to assign a vector of 0's to a multi-bit signal.
<li>Lines 11 and 14 enforce the condition on the fourth row of the truth table,
that when ctrl=01 the counter counts up mod 10.  Note, that I did not include
any complex mathematical operations like division in order to realize the
mod-10, instead checking when the count equals 9 (1001 in binary).
<li>Line 17 enforces the condition on the fifth row of the truth table, that 
when ctrl=10, Q should be assigned D.
<li>Line 19 enforces the condition on the sixth row of the truth table, that
when ctrl=11, Q should be assigned 0
</ul>

Note that the condition ctrl=00 was not assigned a case in the VHDL code.
This is because if a signal is not explicitly changed inside a process, then
it retains its previous value.


<pre>
1.  architecture behavior of modCounter is
	
2.  	signal rollSynch, rollCombo: STD_LOGIC;
3.  	signal processQ: STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (3 downto 0);

4.  begin
5.      process(clk)
6. 	begin
7.  	    if (rising_edge(clk)) then
8.  		if (reset = '0') then
9.  		    processQ <= (others => '0');
10.  		    rollSynch <= '0';
11.  		elsif ((processQ < "1001") and (ctrl = "01")) then
12.  		    processQ <= processQ + 1;
13.  		    rollSynch <= '0';
14.  		elsif ((processQ = "1001") and (ctrl = "01")) then
15.  		    processQ <= (others => '0');
16.  		    rollSynch <= '1';
17.  		elsif (ctrl = "10") then
18.  		    processQ <= D;
19.  		elsif (ctrl = "11") then
20.  		    processQ <= (others => '0');
21.  		end if;
22. 	    end if;
23. 	end process;

24. 	rollCombo  <= '1' when (processQ = 9) else '0';
25. 	Q <= processQ;

26.  end behavior;
</pre>


<h3>General VHDL Rules</h3>
At the risk of being too prescriptive, we will introduce the following rules
that you must follow when designing in VHDL.  The reason for these rules is
simple, following them will help insure that you write code that can be
synthesized.

<ul>	<li>Never use processes for combinational logic
	<li>Only the clk should appear in the sensitivity list
	<li>The outermost structure should be "if (rising_edge(clk)) then"
	<li>Inside this structure should be "if (reset = '0') then" to
		restate the state element used by the process	
	<li>The else clause of the reset element, the body, should consist of a set 
		of exclusive signal conditions in an if/then of case structure.
	<li>Any signal on the LHS of an assignment statement (in the body)
		may not be put on the LHS of any assignment statement outside
		the process
</ul>
