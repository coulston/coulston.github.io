<h2>Synthesis</h2>
Lets consider how we could synthesize the majority circuit.  The essential
observation is that we need to create an association between the entity
specification of the majority circuit and the pin-out of the Xilinx chip.
Out Xilinx chip has 354 pins and is similar to 
<a href="http://numato.cc/sites/default/files/2012/Nov/XC6SLX9CSG225.png">this</a>
chip.  

The designers of the Atlys board decided to connect some of these
pins to specific hardware modules.  These connections are described in the 
<a href="http://www.digilentinc.com/data/products/atlys/atlys_rm_v2.pdf">Atyls Board Reference Manual</a>.
Of interest are the connections described on pages 19, highlighting the switches
and LEDs on the board.
<br><br>

We would like the input to our majority to come from the DIP switches and the output
to go to an LED.  Making some arbitrary choices, let make the associations shown
in the following picture.

<br><img src="./img/lecture03-2.gif"><br><br>

This is accomplished by inserting the following code into a file called 
majority.ucf and adding it to your project (with an implementation association).

<pre>
# This is slide switch SW0
NET "a" LOC = A10;
# This is slide switch SW1
NET "b" LOC = D14;
# This is slide switch SW2
NET "c" LOC = C14;
# This is LED LD0
NET "f" LOC = U18;
</pre>



<h2>Standard Combinational Elements</h2>

A note about a common error that may come up in your designs.  You cannot
use a variable listed on the entity as an out port, on the right hand
side of a signal assignment statement.

<pre>
entity circuit is
    port (clk, data: in std_logic;
	  q, not_q: out std_logic);
end circuit;

architecture error of circuit is
begin
    q <= some cool logical stuf using clk and data;
    not_q <= not q;
end error;
</pre>

The solution is to assign "some cool logical stuff using clk and data" to 
a temporary variable and then have 

<pre>
    temp <= some cool logical stuf using clk and data;
    q <= temp;
    not_q <= not temp;
</pre>


<h3>Mux</h3>
Using the conditional signal assignment statement greatly simplifies the
design of muxes.  In the example below the signal x, y0, y1, y2, and y3
could be std_logic or std_logic_vector.  The select signal S must be
defined as std_logic(1 downto 0);

<pre>
	x <=	y0 when S = "00" else
		y1 when S = "01" else
		y2 when S = "10" else
		y3;
</pre>

<h3>STD_LOGIC_1164 and STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED</h3>
Up to this point we have used STD_LOGIC_1164 library and its associated 9 values
(see lecture 1), primary sticking with '0' and '1' along with the
logic operations (AND, OR, NOT).  All this functionality is made 
available when you put the following two lines at the top of your file.  

<pre>
library IEEE;		
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.all; 
</pre>

Its worth a few minutes to look at the contents of the STD_LOGIC_1164 library at
<a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/VHDL/packages/std_logic_1164.vhd">this</a>
link.  For all its power, the STD_LOGIC_1164 library does not support numerical
values and numerical operations like addition, and comparisons.  
This is where the STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED library comes in.  The 
STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED library supports operations like addition and magnitude
comparsions on STD_LOGIC_VECTORs treated as unsigned binary numbers.
You will seethis library used in most of the generic building blocks
provided to you.  Its worth a few minutes to look at the contents of the 
STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED library file at
<a href="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/VHDL/packages/std_logic_unsigned.vhd">this</a>
link.  
<br><br>

<pre>
library IEEE;		
use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all; 
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED.ALL;


entity genericAdder is
    generic(N: integer := 4);
    port(a,b: in std_logic_vector(N-1 downto 0);
	 sum: out std_logic_vector(N-1 downto 0));
end genericAdder;

architecture behavior of genericAdder is

begin
	sum <= a + b;

end behavior;
</pre>


There are times when it will be handy to convert a decimal number into 
a STD_LOGIC_VECTOR.  For example, perhaps you would like to define the
active width of a 1280x720 monitor in your VHDL file.
<br><br>

In order to do this, you will need to include "use IEEE.NUMERIC_STD.ALL;" 
at the top of your file (along with the other includes). This library gives
you access to the "to_unsigned" function given in the code snippet below.
Then inside your VHDL architecture, before the "begin" statement, include
the following code:

<pre>
constant H_ACTIVE : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(11 downto 0) := std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(1280, 12));
</pre>

This line of code is pretty complex, so let's take a moment to look it
over.  The keyword constant does wht you'd expect, it makes H_ACTIVE an
12-bit constant in your program.  The right hand side of the ":=" assignment
operator creates the 12-bit value for 1280 using the "to_unsigned" operator
and then converts this into a STD_LOGIC_VECTOR.  
<br><br>

This is a pretty handy code-snippet that you may want to use later on.


<h3>Combinations</h3>
One of the most common logic structures you will encounter is a conditional
statement in the form of if/then/else.  While this statement can be directly
implemented using the CSA discussed in lecture 2, its important that you have
some appreciation of how this construct is realized so that you can better
arrange your circuit to reduce the logic required.
<br>
All conditional statements consist of three parts, the condition
to be checked (the if clause), the statement to be evaluated when the 
condition is true (the then clause), and the statement to be evaluated when the
condition is false (the else clause).
Typically, the condition being evaluated seeks the relative magnitude of
two unsigned binary numbers, requiring a comparator.  The then and else 
clauses will typically require some logic or arithmetic operation.
In order to illustrate the hardware realization of a conditional
statement, consider the following example.


<pre>
C:	if (a<4) then z=y+3 else z=y+7
VHDL:	z <= y+3 when (a < 4) else y+7;
</pre>

The following hardware schematic realizes this 

<br><img src="./img/lecture03-1.gif"><br><br>

However, this circuit is not minimal, one of the adders can be removed.
This can be done by realizing that the y input to the adders is constant.
Therefore, we could have muxed through 3 or 7 into an adder with y on the
other port.  You will practice this more in the homework.
