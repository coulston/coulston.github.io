<h1>Homework #10</h1>
Guidelines
<ul>
<li>Complete your work on green engineering paper
<li>Staple in upper left if more than one sheet.
<li>Format the top of the first sheet as follows.
<table border =1>
<tr><td>ECE 383	<td>[Your name]	<td>HW#10	<td>[Due Date]	<td>[Page ref]
</table>
The page reference for the first page of a four page document would be 1/4, the
second page of this document would be labeled 2/4 and so on.  
<li>Do not write on the back side of the green engineering paper
</ul>
<br><br>


<h2>Assignment</h2>
<ol>
<li>Complete the development of the example in Lecture 18.
<li>Modify the lec10 component to include a roll signal that
is asserted whenever the counter is at the maximum count value.
In order to accomplish this with the generic counter width
you may need to create a temporary signal that is equal to the
highest count value. 

<pre>
    maxCount <= (others => '1');
</pre>

</ol>

<h2>Note</h2>
You will most likely get an error that looks like the following:

Look at the MicroBlaze Print Size output and you will find that the value 
under dec (size of your program (instructions + data) in decimal bytes) 
is larger than you 
allocated in EDK for the microblaze memory.  The solution is to 
increase the size of the instruction and data memory in EDK and 
recompile (see figure below). As you will see in the Print Size output
above, I ran into this problem when my program JUST exceeded the 16K 
I had allocated for it in EDK.

After you make this change, you will need to increase the stack and heap
space inside SDK.  To do this, open the linker script (lscript.ld) and then
increase the size of your memory to reflect the size entered in EDK.  Finally
you can increase the stack and heap sizes to cover that needed in the error
message.
