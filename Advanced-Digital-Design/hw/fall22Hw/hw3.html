<h1>Homework #3</h1>
Guidelines
<ul>
<li>Come prepared to answer the first two question on Canvas at the start of
the next class.  Please attempt the third assignment using Vivado installed
on your PC or in the 304/305 labs.
<br><br>


<ol>
<li> Draw a hardware schematic, similar to the one at the end of lecture 3,
for the following circuits.  You are given comparators, muxes and adders;
do NOT show the internal organization of these devices.  Whenever possible 
reduce the number of devices required to realize the design.  You should
assume that X, Y, and Z are unsigned(7 downto 0).

<ol type = "a">
        <li> if (X==0) then Z = X else Z = Y
        <li> if (X==Y) then Z = Y else Z = X+Y
        <li> if (X < Y) then Z = X+4 else Z = Y+6
        <li> if (X > Y) then Z = X+5 else Z = X+6
</ol>

<li>Write a 1-line WHEN statement for each of the if/then statements
assuming the x,y,z are defined as follows.

<pre>
    signal x, y, z : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
</pre>


<li>
Use the instructions in the "How To" section of the web page to
produce a timing diagram for the majority circuit from the first
lecture code section.  You will need to use two files, the VHDL 
source file as well as the testbench.
</ul>
