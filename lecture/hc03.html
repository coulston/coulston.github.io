<h2>Looping structures</h2>
Looping structures iterate a code body some number of times.  Interestingly
the most natural looping structure in assembly language is a count down
loop.  The reason is that it's easy for the CPU to check if a result 
equals 0.  The following C-code snippet is a typical count down loop
that we will use as a template for our assembly for loop.
<pre>
B=0;
for (A=4; A!=0; A-=1) {
    B = B + 1;		// Body of for loop
}
</pre>

The B variable in the body of the for-loop is just there to give the
loop something to do as well as to count the number of times the body
is executed.  The following table lists the value of the loop index,
A, in the body of the for-loop and at the very end of the for-loop,
just before the next iteration.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>A in body	<td>A at end
<tr><td>4		<td>3
<tr><td>3		<td>2
<tr><td>2		<td>1
<tr><td>1		<td>0
</table>

<h3>Count down loop using the A accumulator</h3>

In our count down loop, the accumulator A will play the role of the
variable A in the C-code snippet and the B accumulator will play the
role of the B variable.  The following assembly code performs exactly
the same fuction as the count-down loop above.

<pre>
            CLRB                  ; clear accumulator
            LDAA    #4            ; set the number of iterations
            
For_Down:   INCB                  ; These two lines are the body
            NOP                   ; of the loop
            DBNE    A, For_Down  
</pre>

Some notes about this program are in order.
<ul>	<li>DBNE - Decrement Branch Not Equal.  The DBNE instruction
	decrements the selected accumulator and branches to the target 
	address if after decrementing the accumulator  does not equal 0.

	<li>The For_Down label is an alias for an address in
	the instruction memory.  It allows us to avoid hard
	coding in address which can be problematic.
</ul>


<h3>For Loop - count up using the A accumulator</h3>
The following C-code snippet is more reminisent of a regular for-loop
that you might program in one of your assignments.  Ironically, this
type of loop is a bit of a pain to program in assembly language as we
will see below.
<pre>
B=0;	
for (A=0; A<4; A+=1) {	
    B = B + 1;	
}
</pre>

The B variable in the body of the for-loop play the same role as the
previous program, just to give the body something to do and to keep
track of the number of times the body is executed.
The assembly code for the count-up for-loop is shown below.  The
A accumulator plays the role of the A variable in the C-code.  The
same goes for the B accumulator.

<pre>
            CLRB                  ; clear accumulator
            LDAA    #0            ; 
            
For_Up:     CMPA    #Loop_Its     ; compare it to target loop iteration
            BEQ     Next_For_Up   ; exit loop if A == #Loop_Its
            
            INCB                  ; These two lines are the body
            NOP                   ; of the for loop
            INCA                  ; Increment the loop count variable and
            BRA     For_Up        ; iterate again

Next_For_Up:
</pre>

In this program we do not have the luxery of using a built-in 
HCS12 instruction to perform a decrement and branch instruction so 
we need the INCA instruction to increment the loop index variable and
the pait of instructions CMPA and BEQ to terminate the loop when the 
number of iterations has reached its target.  Thus, a count-up loop
requires 3 instructions instead of the count-down loops 1 instruction.

<h3>For Loop - count up with loop variable stored in RAM</h3>
Often you will have need to use the A register for more than
just a loop counter, as in the previous problem.  In this case
you will want to move the current loop count into and out-of the
A register.  The idea in the code segment below is to store the
current loop count index in the memory location related to the Loop_Cnt
label.  When needed, this index variable is loaded into accumulaor A
and compared to the constant Loop_Its.  This is done at the start of the
loop at the label For_Mem.  The body of the for loop may do what it wants
with accumulator A, it just needs to make sure to store any important value
before the start of the next iterations because the start of the loop will
overwite accumulator.  At the end of the loop the Loop_Its memory location
is increment and an unconditional branch takes up back to the begining.

<pre>
Loop_Its:   EQU     4             ; Defines an assembler-time constant
Loop_Cnt:   DS.B    1             ; allocates 1 byte in RAM
Temp:       DS.B    1

            CLR     Loop_Cnt      ; Initialize the loop counter
            CLR     Temp          ; Clear temporary var in memory
            
For_Mem:    LDAA    Loop_Cnt
            CMPA    #Loop_Its     ; compare it to target loop iteration
            BEQ     Next_For_Mem  ; exit loop if A == #Loop_Its 
            
            INC     Temp          ; These two lines are the body
            NOP                   ; of the for loop

            INC     Loop_Cnt      ; Increment the loop count variable and
            BRA     For_Mem       ; iterate again
Next_For_Mem: 
</pre>
