<h1>I2C</h1>
There are a variety of serial communication protocols that exit
to handle different application areas.   The term protocol means an 
accepted standard for data interchange.  We have already studied
RS232 - an asynchronous protocol where two devices share 2
lines (TX and RX) to communicate information.  Today we will introduce 
the Inter IC (I2C) protocol.
We will examine the I2C protocol from the lowest level of abstraction, the
electrical interface, up to the most complex, which is the interaction
between a master and slave device to exchange data.

<br><br>

You may remember that RS232 has two signals, RX and TX, both are data lines.
There is no clock signal in RS232.  Thus, in order to decode a bit stream,
the sender and receiver must agree on the duration of a bit period.
This is the baud rate.  This type of communication is refered to as 
asynchronous.
<br><br>

I2C is a synchronous communication protocol. This means that I2C has 
an explicit clock signal shared between sender and receiver.
In addition to a clock signal, called SCL, an I2C bus has a data signal 
called SDA.  The term "bus" implies that many devices may be attached to 
the SCL and SDA signals.  One devices on the I2C bus is selected 
to be the bus master.  The bus master is the only device which may 
manipulate the SCL signal. The device the bus master is communicating
with is, by convention, called the slave devices.  Both the master and
slave may manipulate the SDA line.
<br><Br>

Since the SDA signal is driven by both the master and slave, there 
exists the very real possibility of a bus fault.  A bus fault occurs
when two devices assert oppsite logical levels on a bus line at the
same time.  This creates a short circuit; bad things are bound to 
happen in short order.
<br><br>

To prevent a bus fault, the SCL and SDA outputs on any device that
is connected to an I2C bus need to be open drain.  A device with an 
open drain output can ground the output or place its output in a
high-impedance state - it cannot drive its output to logic 1.  When
a devices puts its output in a high-impedance state, it means that
the output is connected to nothing - the signal is floating.  A
pair of external resistors, one each on SDA and SCL, pull the
signal lines high when all the devices on the I2C bus put their 
outputs in the high-impedance state.

 This configuration is shown
in the following image.
<br><img src="http://www.lammertbies.nl/picture/i2c_interface.png"><br><br>

Open drain configurations safe guard devices on the bus, because the
devices on the bus can never assert conflicting voltages.  Thus
preventing a short circuit.  You can find these pull-up resistors on the 
SCL and SDA lines on our development board.
<br><br>

A I2C bus typically operates at one of
the following clock rates.  These rates determine how fast data is
communicated across the bus, not how fast the devices will process
the data.  Often after a slave device is given a task (like storing a
page of data) it will enter a busy state where it will refuse any
attempt to communicate with it.
<ul>	<li>100kHz - standard mode
	<li>400kHz - full speed
	<li>1MHz - fast mode
	<li>3.2MHz - high speed
</ul>

Since there multiple devices on the bus, each devices is assigned a 
unique 7-bit address, called its device address.  Often IC manufactures 
will include one or more pins on the IC which configures a portion of this 
7-bit address.  For example, the 24LC256 EEPROM from microchips has three
pins A2, A1, and A0 (shown in the figure below), that configure the
least three significant bits of the device address.
<br><Br>

<table border=1>
<tr><td>Device Address		<td>Package
<tr><td>1 0 1 0 A2 A1 A0	<td><img src="./img/24lc256.bmp"><br><Br>
</table><br><Br>

For example, if you connected the A2 and A0 pins to Vcc and pin A1 to GND, then
the device address of the EEPROM would be  "0b1010101".  Allowing the address
to be configurable, allows a designer (you) to include multiple 24LC256
EEPROMs on a single I2C bus.
<br><br>

Before starting any communication with a device on the I2C bus, the 
bus-master announces its intention to every device on the bus by 
asserting a start-condition.  The start condition involves pulling
the SDA line to logic 0 while the SCL line is at logic 1.  After this
is done, the bus master will send out a series of 9 clock pulses with
one bit associated with each.  The first packet of 9-bits is used by
the bus-master to select which slave device it wants to exchange data
with.
<br><br>

<ul>
<li>In its idle state, the SCL and SDA signal are held high.
<li>To initiate communication on an I2C bus, the bus master asserts a
start condition.  A start condition, shown in the timing diagram
below, means driving SDA low while SCL is high.  This tells all
the devices on the I2C bus that the bus master will be sending out
the device address of the device that the bus master want to communicate
with. 
<li>The bus master sends out the 7-bit device address followed by a single bit
R/<font style="text-decoration: overline;">W</font>.  The "R" stands for
read and the "W" stands for write.  The overbar on "W" should be interpreted
as a Boolean logic negation, meaning that you elicit the "W" function (write) 
when the bit value is 0.  The lack of an overbar on "R" means that you get
the "R" function (read) when this bit is 0. 
<li>If there is a (slave) device on the bus with this device address and its
not busy (in hibernation mode), the slave device pulls the data line low
during the 9<sup>th</sup> SCL clock cycle. This is called an 
acknowledgement (ACK) condition.  There are times when a slave device
with a atching device address may not assert an ACK.  For example, the
the device may be preoccupied with a prior task (like an EEPROM
is committing a page of data into its non-volatile storage).
<li>If the bus master sees the ACK condition, then it sends data or
commands to the slave device.
<li>When the bus master has completed its interaction with the slave
device, the bus master asserts a STOP condition, pulloing the SDA line
high while the SCL line is high.  The STOP condition terminates this
bus transaction.
</ul>

The registers in the PIC support I2C.  The details are fairly involved,
but not beyond the comprehension of a curious mind.  Looking at 
page 242 of our PIC 18F26K22 technical documents revals the following
sequence:
<br><Br>

<table border=1>
<tr><td>Master broadcasts start condition 
	<td>SSP2CON2.SEN = 1
<tr><td>Master broadcasts device address 
	<td>SSP2BUF = 0b1010000 0
<tr><td>Slave acknowledges			
	<td>SSP2CON2.ACKSTAT is cleared
<tr><td>Master transmits upper 8-bits of EEPROM address
	<td>SSP2BUF = addr>>8;
<tr><td>Slave acknowledges 			
	<td>SSP2CON2.ACKSTAT is cleared
<tr><td>Master transmits lower 8-bits of address
	<td>SSP2BUF = (addr & 0xFF);
<tr><td>Slave acknowledges			
	<td>SSP2CON2.ACKSTAT is cleared
<tr><td>Master transmits data (perhaps many times)
	<td>SSP2BUF = data;
<tr><td>Slave acknowledges (once for each piece of data)
	<td>SSP2CON2.ACKSTAT is cleared
<tr><td>Master broadcasts stop condition  
	<td>SSP2CON2.PEN=1
