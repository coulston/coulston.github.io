<h2>Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) algorithm</h2>
The last lecture presented a schematic descrption of the DDS architecture
using digital hardware.  The DDS hardware uses a phase accumulator that counts 
up by the phase increment at the update rate.  The integer portion of the 
phase accumulator is used to as the address to a ROM containing one period 
of waveform you are trying to reproduce.  The output of the ROM is sent to 
a digital to analog converter (DAC) to produce the analog waveform.  In our
case, the ADC consisted of the PWM subsystem of the PIC coupled to a low
pass filter (LPF), that converted a D% duty cycle waveform from the PWM
subsystem into a 3.3V * D% analog output.<br><br>

Fine frequency control over the output waveform is made possible by having
fractional values for the phase accumulator and phase increment.  While 
only the integer portion of the phase accumulator is used as the address to
the ROM, the fractional portion of the phase accumulator allows fractional 
portions of the phase increment to accumulate and eventually manifest 
themselves in the integer portion.<br><br>

To make this discussion concrete, let's examine the DDS system implemented
in the following algorithm.  In this example, we are trying to reproduce 
a sine wave using a 16 element ROM.  This ROM will require 4-bits of
address to access all 16 elements.  For this example, we will use a 
4.12 format number for both the phase increment and phase accumulator.
We need the 4 integer bits of the fixed-point number because we need
to access all 16 elements in the ROM.  I had a choice of 4 fractional 
bits (to form an 8-bit variable), or 12-bits (to form a 16-bit variable).
I choose 12-bits because I wanted very precise frequency control (more
on this later). <br>
<br>

In order to access the array, we have to remove the fractional bits from
the phase accumulator.  This is accomplished in the algorithm by shifting
the phase accumulator right by 12-bits and storing the resulting value 
in a temporary register.<br>

<pre>
    int8 sin[16] = {127,176,217,245,254,245,217,176,127,78,37,10,0,1,37,78};

    // Since there are 16 entries in ROM, we will use 4.12 format
    int16 phaseAccumulator, phaseIncrement, index;

    phaseAccumulator = 0;
    phaseIncrement = &lt;value&gt;

    for(;;) {
	delayTenMicroSeconds();
	phaseAccumulator = phaseAccumulator + phaseIncrement;
	index = phaseAccumulator &gt;&gt; 12;
	PWM4_LoadDutyValue(sin[index]);		// Assume an 8-bit duty cycle
    }
</pre>

The code shown in the algorithm is a mix of real-code and pseudo-code.
The call to "delayTenMicroSeconds();" will be replaced with an interrupt
call in future algorithms (the infinite loop will also be removed).  The 
value of phaseIncrement is set by some actor who controls the frequency
of the output waveform - usually main. Remember that the duty cycle of 
a PWM waveorm is set by the 8-bit value in the CCPx register (from
a previous lecture) or by using the built-in functions provided by 
MCC.<br><br>

To better understand what is happening with the code, try to complete
the following tables which describe the values of the phaseAccumulator
through time and the values of the ROM it selects.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td colspan=4">phaseIncrement = 0x0D40</td>
<tr><td>Time (us)<td>phaseAccumulator	<td>index	<td>CCPx

<h2>DDS calculations</h2>

Let's examine the phase increment in our algorithm above and its
relationship to the frequencies produced by the system.  Note,
in the algorithm that the update rate is set at 10us and the 
ROM has 16 entries.
<br><Br>

<b>Question:</b><br>
What phase increment will produce an output waveform with 440 Hz?
Represent the phase increment in decimal and in 4.12 format.
<br><Br>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
<pre>
 1 update   10^6 us   X phase inc      1 wave    
 -------- * ------- * ----------- * -------------  = 440 Hz
   10us       1s       1 update      16 phase inc  
</pre>
X = 0.0704<br>
In 4.12 format, 0.0704*2<sup>12</sup> = 288.4 which rounds to 288.<br>
288 in binary is 0000 0001 0010 0000, shifting the decimal point left by
12 bits yields 0000.000100100000
<br><Br>

<b>Question:</b><br>
What output waveform frequency will a phase increment of 0.1234 produce?
<br><Br>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
<pre>
 1 update   10^6 us   0.1234 phase inc     1 wave    
 -------- * ------- * ---------------- * ------------  = 771.25 Hz
   10us       1s           1 update      16 phase inc  
</pre>


<h2>Frequency resolution</h2>
Now let's examine some performance metrics associated with a DDS
system.  One of the most important is the frequency resolution; 
the smallest change possible with a DDS setup.  In order to answer
this question we need to introduce the concept of consectutive 
representations for fixed-point numbers.  Two fixed-point numbers
will be said to have consectutive representations if one of them
can be derived by adding binary 0000001 to the other.  For example,
in a 4.4 format numbers 0010 1101 and 0010 1100 are consectutive 
representations (since you can add binary 00000001 to the second number
and arrive at the first number) while 0010 1101 and 0010 1110 
are not consectutive representations.
<br><Br>

<b>Question:</b><br>
Given a 4.12 format number what is the change in value between 
consectutive representations in 4.12 format and in decimal?
<br><br>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
Given two consectutive representations of 4.12 numbers, the difference
between them will always be  0000.000000000001 or 2<sup>-12</sup>.
This works out to 244*10<sup>-6</sup>. 
<br><Br>

<b>Question:</b><br>
Given a 4.12 format number for the phaseIncrement and phaseAccumulator, a 
10us update rate, and a 16 entry ROM, what is the frequency change between
consectutive representations of the phaseIncrement?
<br><br>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
From the previous question we know that the difference between consectutive
4.12 numbers is 0000.000000000001 or 2<sup>-12</sup> = 244*10<sup>-6</sup>. 
Using this difference as the phase increment in our DDS equations yields:

<pre>
 1 update   10^6 us   244*10<sup>-6</sup>phase inc      1 wave    
 -------- * ------- * ----------------- * -----------  = 1.53 Hz
    10us     1s            1 update       16 phase inc  
</pre>
<br><br>

This is a general result, there will always be 1.53Hz difference 
between consectutive representation. This value is so important,
it is given a name, <u>frequency resolution</u>.  To recap, the 
frequency resolution of a DDS system is the frequency change between 
consectutive representations of the phase increment.  The 
frequency resolutions is affected by update rate, 
fixed point format of the phase increment and ROM size.  Let's see
how one of these factors affects the frequency resolution of our
DDS algorithm.
<Br><br>

<b>Question:</b><br>
Let's change the datatype of phaseIncrement and phaseAccumulator
from int16 to int8.  What is the frequency resolution of the resulting
algorithm?
<br><br>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
Our phase increment will no longer be a 4.12 format number because these
16-bits will not fit into an int8.  Since we need 4 integer bits to
access the ROM, this leaves only 4 fractional bits.  Thus, the phase
increment is a 4.4 format number.<br><br>

The change in value between consectutive 4.4 representations is 
0000.0001 = 2<sup>-4</sup> = 0.0625<br><br>

Now we can use our DDS equation to determine the frequency resolution using 
the phase increment between consectutive representations of the phase
increment.<br>

<pre>
 1 update   10^6 us   0.0625 phase inc      1 wave    
 -------- * ------- * ---------------- * -----------  = 391 Hz
    10us     1s            1 update      16 phase inc  
</pre>


<h2>DDS with interrupts</h2>


<pre>
uint8_t sin[16] = {127,176,217,245,254,245,217,176,127,78,37,10,0,1,37,78};

// This need to be global because they are shared between ISR and main
uint16_t phaseIncrement = 0x0123;

//*****************************************************************
//*****************************************************************
void high_priority interrupt tmr0_isr(void) {
 
    static uint16_t phaseAccumulator = 0;
    uint16_t index;

    phaseAccumulator = phaseAccumulator + phaseIncrement;
    index = phaseAccumulator &gt;&gt; 12;
    PWM4_LoadDutyValue(sin[index]);		// Assume an 8-bit duty cycle

    TMR0_WriteTimer(TMR0_ReadTimer() + (0xFFFF - RATE));
    INTCONbits.TMR0IF = 0;		// Clear the timer rollover flag

} // end timer compare interrupt
</pre>

<li> Given a DDS system with an update rate of 10us, a 8 entry ROM,
and a 3.5 format fixed point phase increment, what phase increment
generates a frequency of 20kHz?


<!--
<b>Answer:</b><br>
<pre>
 1 update   10^6 us   X phase inc      1 wave
 -------- * ------- * ----------- * ------------  = 20,000Hz
   10us      1s        1 update     8 phase inc

Solving for X yields 1.6 
As a 3.5 format number:
    1.6*32 = 51.2 rounded = 51
    51 = 0011 0011 = 0x33

<li> Given a DDS system with an update rate of 10us, a 8 entry ROM,
and a 3.5 format fixed point phase increment, what phase increment
generates a frequency of 120kHz?


<!--
<b>Answer:</b><br>
<pre>
 1 update   10^6 us   X phase inc      1 wave

Solving for X yields 9.6 
This value cannot be represented as a 3.5 format number because
3.5 format numbers are in the range [0 to 7.97]

<li>Your engineering design team has tasked you with developing the DDS engine
for a microcontroller platform that will be deployed in a radar application.
The N-bit output of the DDS engine is sent to a N-bit DAC which converts
this input into an output between 0v - 1v.  This application requires
the DDS to generate a sinusoid over a broad range of frequencies that
can be finely-adjusted.  Your team has decided on a microcontroller
family having 3 different models with 8kB, 32kB and 128kB of RAM with
a commensurate increasing unit cost.  The design of the DDS engine will
play an important role in determining the memory footprint in the RAM
and consequently which model to choose.  Your technical lead needs you
to provide the following.

<ol>
<li>Investigate the trade-off between the length of the DDS lookup table
(number of rows in the RAM) and the minimum step size on the output
of the DAC (measured in volts).  To do this make a table (in excel)
with two columns, number of rows in the RAM (between 2^4 and 2^16) and
step size (in volts).  Remember that the maximum slope of a sinusoid is 1. 
 
<li>Assume that you are working with a 16-bit word using a w.f formatted
fixed point number.  Investigate the trade-off between the number of
whole number bits and fractional bits and the frequency resolution of
the DDS subsystem.  Since you are working with a 16-bit word, w + f = 16.
