<h1>Bit Twiddling</h1>
Through this section we will be working at a bit-level on an N-bit
operand.  To accomplish this we will need an N-bit mask and some
logical operation.  
<dl>
	<dt>N-bit operand
	<dd>This is the value what we want to manipulate.  Typically
	defined as a variable in a program.
	<dt>
	<dt>Bit masking
	<dd>The process by which you select, clear or set specific bits
	in an N-bit operand.
	<dt>N-bit mask
	<dd>An ordered arrangement of N-bits which indicates a subset
	of bits to operate on.  Typically a 1 in bit position i of the
	mask implies that the operation should be performed on bit i
	of the operand.
	<dt>Logical operation
	<dd>An operation which is performed on operands representing 
	truth values true and false, denoted by the two digits 0 and 1.
	There are three common logical operations.
	<ul>
	<li>AND denoted with the symbol "&", used to clear bits
	<li>OR denoted with the symbol  "|", used to set bits
	<li>XOR denoted with the symbol "^", used to flip bits
	</ul>
</dl>

<h2>Masks</h2>
As an embedded programmer, you will build three types of mask, 
constant, inverted, and variable.  Lets look at examples of each.
<dl>
<dt>Constant
<dd>A constant mask does not change during the execution of a program,
hence as its name implies, is constant.  Typical example include selecting
the least significant 4-bits of variable using the mask 0x000F.
<dt>Invert
<dd>An inverted mask does not change during the execution of a program,
but to reduce program complexity or to improve readability is given as
the inverse.  For example, select all but the least significant 4-bits
of a variable using ~(0x000F).
<dt>Variable
<dd>A variable mask may change during the execution of a program,
hence as its name implies, is variable.  Typical example include selecting
the ith-bits of variable using the mask (0x1 << i)
</dl>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
Given
<ul>	<li>A 8-bit variable X
	<li>A 32-bit variable A
	<li>A index 0<=i<8
</ul>

Find:
<ul>	<li>Is X a power of 2?
<!-----
if ((X & (X - 1)) == 0) then X is a power of 2
X	00100		01001
X-1	00011		01000
X&(X-1)	00000		01000
------->
	<li>Swap X and Y without a temporary variable
<!-----
	X = X ^ Y;
	Y = X ^ Y;	// Y = (X^Y)^Y = X^(Y^Y) = X^0 = X
	X = X ^ Y;	// X = (X^Y)^X = Y^(X^X) = Y^0 = Y

X=00100;	Y=01010;
	X = X^Y	= 01110
	Y = X^Y = 00100	
	X = X^Y = 01010
------->
	<li>Count the number of bits set in X and put into variable c
<!------
for (c = 0; X != 0; c++)
  X &= X - 1; 	// clear the least significant bit set
------->
	<li>Compute modulus division by 1 << s 

<!------
const unsigned int n;          // numerator
const unsigned int s;
const unsigned int d = 1U << s; // So d will be one of: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
unsigned int m;                // m will be n % d
m = n & (d - 1); 
------->
	<li>Round up to the next highest power of 2

<!------
unsigned int v; // compute the next highest power of 2 of 32-bit v

v--;
v |= v >> 1;
v |= v >> 2;
v |= v >> 4;
v |= v >> 8;
v |= v >> 16;
v++;
------->

	<li>Compute parity of A (sum of numbers of 1's mod 2)
<!-----
A ^= A >> 16;
A ^= A >> 8;
A ^= A >> 4;
A &= 0xf;
return (0x6996 >> v) & 1;

The three shift operations fold A in half, perserving the parity
at each step.
the "magic number" is a binary LUT, bit position i is the 
parity of the binary number i.
----->

	<li>Compute the next power of 2 larger than X?
<!-----
X--
X |= X >> 1;   
X |= X >> 2;
X |= X >> 4;
X |= X >> 8;
X |= X >> 16;
X++;
----->
	<li>Isolate least significant bit set.
<!-----
X & -X		// this is a 2's complement negation
----->
	<li>Check if X is even or odd
<!-----
X & 1		// LSB=0 => even
----->

	<li>Reverse the bits in a Byte
<!-----
X = ((X >> 1) & 0x55) | ((X << 1) & 0xaa);
X = ((X >> 2) & 0x33) | ((X << 2) & 0xcc);
X = ((X >> 4) & 0x0f) | ((X << 4) & 0xf0);

The first operation swaps the bits in the lower nibble.
The second operation swaps the bits in the upper nibble.
The third operation swaps the nibbles
----->

	<li>Max of X and Y into X without branching
<!-----
X -= Y;
X &= (~X) >> 31;
X += Y;
----->
