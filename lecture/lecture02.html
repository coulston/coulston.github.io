<h1>Operations</h1>
When you write code to perform a computation, you are manipulating 
one or more operands using an operation.  The operands are the data
values being manipulated and the operation defines how the operands
are manipulated.  The execution of a C operation generates a result 
that depends, in part, on the data type of the operands.  This 
dependency is generally a result of overflow, a topic that we will
take up shortly. The operands and operators are combined into C
expressions, combinations of one or more constants, variables, 
operators, and functions evaluated to produce result. Today we will
look at several different types of operations and operands common
to many of the C programs you will write in this class.  However,
before we get started lets examine a helpful C construct to alias
data types and make our programs self documenting and more readable.

<h2>typedef</h2>
C provides a way to provide an alias to a data type using the 
keyword <u>typedef</u>.  This keyword allows you to
rename a data type.  This is especially common on large development
projects where code is shared across hardware and software platforms
which may have different size interpretations for types like "int".  The
following declarations are made <u>outside main</u> in the 
area you would generally use for global variables and include statements.

<pre>
	typedef unsigned char  uint8_t;
	typedef signed char    int8_t;
	typedef unsigned int   uint16_t;
	typedef signed int     int16_t;
	typedef unsigned long  uint32_;
	typedef signed long    int32_t;
</pre>

Fortunately for you, these declarations are automatically included in the
XC8 compiler used in our class whenever you put 
<font face="courier">#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;</font> at the top of you
program (before main).  We will do this in all our programs in lab and
so will assume the same for all programs written in class.

<h2>Main, variable declaration and assignment</h2>
Every C program starts running at the beginning of a code module 
(a function) called "main".  In our class, you will always identify
main using the declaration, <font face="courier">void main(void) {</font>.
Every line of code after this and up to the closing "}" is considered to
be in main.  An example program is given below and used in the following
discussion.<br><br>

<pre>
void main(void) {

    uint8_t x = 100;
    uint8_t z;

    z = x + x;
}
</pre>

After you declare main, most of your programs will have variable 
declarations.  These should all be placed at the top of main before
any of the expressions composing the body of your program.  While
some C compilers may allow it, it is generally frowned on to include 
new variable declarations in the body of your programs.  C is 
"typed language" meaning that you are required to declare the data 
type for any variable that you want to use.  You do this by placing 
the data-type followed by the variable name, and an optional initial value
on a single line followed by a semicolon.
<br><br>

In the example above, the variables x and z are stored in 8-bits and 
interpreted as unsigned 
binary numbers.  This means that we can store the values [0, 255] in
these variables.  The variable declaration 
<font face="courier">uint8_t x = 100;</font> initializes the variable
x, so the first time that it is referenced in the program (if it hasn't
already been changed), it has value 100.   The value of x can be changed 
anywhere in your program - an initial value does not make a variable
a constant.
<br><br>

I don't really consider variable declarations to be code that is
executed, rather it sets aside space for our variables that are
manipulated by the following instructions.  The real work of the program
occurs with the expression composing the body of the program.  In the 
very simple program above, the body consists of a single statement
<font face="courier">z = x + x;</font>  The equal sign in this expression
divides the statement into a left had side (LHS) and a right hand side
(RHS).  The computer will evaluate the expression on the RHS and assign
it to the variable on the LHS.  The computer evaluates an expression by
looking up the values for any variables, then applying operations to
the operands until the RHS is reduced to a single value.  In our simple
program, evaluating <font face="courier">x + x</font> produces the value
200, which is then assigned to the variable z.  Any subsequent reference
to the variable z (on a RHS), will cause z to evaluate to 200.<br><br>
<!--
The concept of evaluation requires us to consider operator precedence
which needs to be added to this lecture in subsequent revisions.
-->

All went well in our example; the result of the evaluation, 200, was
able to "fit" into the uint8_t data type for the result variable z.
However, this will not always be the case.  Unlike general purpose
computers, microcontrollers will almost never alert you when the
evaluation of an expression is too large to fit into the result 
variable.  For example, what would happen if x = 200 when the 
statement <font face="courier">z = x + x;</font> is executed by a 
microcontroller?

<h2>Overflow and modular arithmetic</h2>
When performed with the correct sized data type, you should rarely 
need to concern yourself what happen when the result of an operation 
exceeds the ability of data-type to hold it.  If you peform an operation 
on data which yields a result that exceed the range of the word-size
you have generated an <u>overflow</u> condition.<br><br>

Let's look at a simple case of overflow to more clearly understand what
is going on.  Let's work on a hypothetical computer that has a uint3_t data
type (a 3-bit word size).  A 3-bit integer can only represent values
from [0 &hellip; 7] inclusive.  When interperted as integers the 
decimal values for each
possible 3-bit word are shown at left in the figure below.  The values
are arranged in clockwise counting order.  As you count up from 0, you
should travel clockwise around the circle encountering incrementally 
larger numbers.  But what is going on when we reach 7 and increment back
to 0?<br><Br>

The hardware that performs the addition of two values
inside the computer is called an adder.  Adders are built from full-adders.
The adder for our imaginary machine has 3 full adders, forming what is called
a 3-bit adder.  When told to add 1 to 7, the 3-bit adder cannot generate
the value 8 because it has a 4-bit representation, 0b1000.  By its nature,
the 3-bit adder keeps the least significant 3-bits from the sum 7+1, yielding
a result 0.<br><br>

Now let's perform an operation on data that will yield an overflow: 5+4.  
Let's use a adding technique that you first learned in school, counting 
off on a number line, however in our case, let's count around our circle.
In the figure at right, we start at 5 and count-up around the circle 4
times, landing on the value 1.   So 5+4=1.  

<br><img src="./img/threeBit.bmp"><br><br>

You could also arrive at this
answer by performing 5+4=9, and then recognizing that 9 is greater than
the largest 3-bit representation, subtract off 1 encirclement of the 
3-bit counting wheel, 8.  Hence, I would write 5+4 = 9-8 = 1.  You will
find this second technique more useful when diagonising overflow problems
in your programs.  Let's do one more example using an 8-bit word-size.
<br><br>

Let's return to the example at the end of the previous section, the computer
was trying to store the value 400 (200 + 200) into the variable z.  Since
z has type uint8_t it can only store values in the range [0, 255].  Most
microcontollers will not halt execution on this error and instead 
store the least significant 8-bit of the binary representation of 400 
in z.  You can verify that 400 = 0b110010000, so z = 0b10010000 
which is equal to 144 when interpreted as an unsigned decimal value.  I
tend to prefer a more graphic portrayal of what happens and think that
when we try to count past the maximum value that z can hold, in this case
255, we wrap around back to 0 instead of going to 256.  Thus we drop a 
set of 256 every time we count past 255.  In the example above this would
assign z the value of 400 - 256 = 144.  
<br><br>

If we were in an advanced computer science class, we would call the 
operation of subtracting sets of 256 from a value until the value 
is less than 256, finding the residue modulo 256.
<br><br>

You need to be on the look-out for invalid answers generated by the 
operations because the microcontroller will not provide you with any
indication that overflow has occurred.  Be vigilant!


<h2>C arithmetic operations</h2>
The most familiar type of operations are those that you learned 
early in elementary school, arithmetic operations.  Let's look at 
a C-code example consisting of variable declarations and expressions
and then evaluate the expressions.  You should notice that,
<ul>	<li>every expression is terminated with a semicolon 
	<li>variable are declared before any expressions 
	<li>variables can be assigned an initial value in their declaration
	<li>Comments are denoted with the "//" symbol
	<li>expression are on the right side of the "=" sign
	<li>the value of the expression is assigned to the variable on the 
	left side of the "=" sign
</ul>

<pre>
void main(void) {

    uint8_t x = 25;
    uint8_t y = 15;
    uint8_t z = 10;

    // comments will contain variable values after expression is executed
    z = x + y;		// z = 40
    z = x - y;		// z = 10
    z += x;		// z = 35
    z = x++;		// z = 25, x = 26

    // expressions which generate overflow
    z = y - x;		// z = 245 (15 - 26 = -11 rolls to 256 - 11 = 245)
    z = x * y;		// z = 134 (26*15 = 390 mod 256 = 134) remember x=26!

    // expressions which invoke operator precedence
    z = 3*(x + y);	// z = 123 (3*(26+15) = 123)
} // end main
</pre>
<br><br>


<h2>Operator Precedence</h2>
Operator precedence tells you how to evaluate an expression where there
is ambiguity about the order in which operators are applied to the operands.
The list from <a href="http://microchipdeveloper.com/tls2101:precedence">
this</a> Microchips website is reproduced below.
<br><br>


<i>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
In the following table operators grouped together in a section have the
 same precedence. For example, the first four entries in this table (),
 [], ., and -&gt; all share the same precedence. These four operators
 follow the rule of Left-to-Right associativity which is used as a tie
 breaker when two or more of these appear in the same expression. The
 next group of operators starting with + and ending with (type) all share
 the next level of precedence.

<h2>C bitwise logical operations</h2>
Bitwise logical operations are the familiar AND, OR, XOR and NOT 
performed on each pair of bits from the same bit-position in each 
operand.  We will explain this with an examples, but first let's 
revview the logic operators AND, OR, XOR and NOT.
<br><br>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr>	<td>operations	<td>AND	<td>OR	<td>XOR	<td>NOT
<tr>	<td>symbol	<td>&	<td>|	<td>^	<td>~
<tr>	<td>truth table
	<td><table>	<tr><td>0 & 0 = 0
			<tr><td>0 & 1 = 0
			<tr><td>1 & 0 = 0
			<tr><td>1 & 1 = 1	</table>
	<td><table>	<tr><td>0 | 0 = 0
			<tr><td>0 | 1 = 1
			<tr><td>1 | 0 = 1
			<tr><td>1 | 1 = 1	</table>
	<td><table>	<tr><td>0 ^ 0 = 0
			<tr><td>0 ^ 1 = 1
			<tr><td>1 ^ 0 = 1
			<tr><td>1 ^ 1 = 0	</table>
	<td><table>	<tr><td>~ 0 = 1
			<tr><td>~ 1 = 0		</table>
</table>

With these tables in hand, let's look at an example of a C 
bitwise logical operator using the following line of code.
<pre>
	uint8_t x;

	x = 0b10100011 & 0b11001010;
</pre>

This line of code will assign the bitwise logical AND of the two binary
operands to the variable x.  To do this, for each bit position 
(from the least significant bit to the most significant bit), get the pair 
of operand bits, AND them together, and place the resulting bit in the 
result at this same bit position.
<br><br>

In order to make this process easier, I like to align the operands on
top of each other (like when you add two multi-digit numbers together)
and AND each pair of bits in a coloumn as shown below.  Note,
that I like to seperate long binary numbers into 4-bit units with a 
space so that I can more easily work with them.

<pre>
		  1010 0011
		& 1100 1010
		-----------
		x=1000 0010
	Hence,
	x = 0b10100011 & 0b11001010 = 0b10000010;
</pre>


Just in case this isn't clear, look at the least signifiant bit 
(right-most) in the operation above.  The 1 on top is ANDed with the
0 on the bottom.  From the truth table for AND you should verify that
1 & 0 = 0.  Hence the least significant bit of the result is 0.
Unlike the carry bit in addition, the AND of any one slice can not 
effect the AND in adjacent bit slices.
<br><br>

The process to determine the bitwise logical value for a pair of
variables is identical to that for constants.  Just align the bits
and determine the value of the result based on the operation.  There
is one variation of this idea called bit-masking that proves to be 
very useful tool to test and isolate bits in a variable.  For
example, the following code-snippet tells you the bit value of the
most significant bit of an 8-bit variable x.

<pre>
	if ((x & 0b10000000) == 0)
		printf("MSB of x is 0.\r\n");
	else		
		printf("MSB of x is 1.\r\n");
</pre>

In the explaination that follows, the 8-bits of x are denoted as 
x<sub>7</sub> x<sub>6</sub> x<sub>5</sub> x<sub>4</sub> 
x<sub>3</sub> x<sub>2</sub> x<sub>1</sub> x<sub>0</sub>.  So what
we are cheking is the value of x<sub>7</sub> in our code segment.
The code snippet works because 0 ANDed with any bit is equal to
0. While 1 ANDed with a bit x, is equal to x.  These two relationships
are described in the following:

<pre>
		    x<sub>7</sub> x<sub>6</sub> x<sub>5</sub> x<sub>4</sub> x<sub>3</sub> x<sub>2</sub> x<sub>1</sub> x<sub>0</sub>
		&   1  0  0  0  0 0  0  0
		    ----------------------
		    x<sub>7</sub> 0  0  0  0 0  0  0
	
</pre>

The result of "(x & 0b10000000)" is either equal to 1000 0000 if 
x<sub>7</sub> is 1 or 0000 0000 if x<sub>7</sub> is 0.
Because "0" is easier to write than "10000000", I checked the
result against 0.  Note that "0" is the same as "00000000" because the
compiler will always pad values with leading zeros.
<br><Br>

The following are some bitwise logical operations that you can try on your
own.  The solutions are shown in the comments.

<pre>
void main(void) {

    uint8_t x = 0b10101100;
    uint8_t y = 0b00110101;
    uint8_t z = 0;

    // comments will contain variable values after expression is executed
    z = x & 0x0F;	// z = 0b0000 1100
    z = x & 0xF0;	// z = 0b1010 0000
    z = x | 0x0F;	// z = 0b1010 1111
    z = x | 0xF0;	// z = 0b1111 1100
    z = x ^ 0x0F;	// z = 0b1010 0011
    z = x ^ 0xF0;	// z = 0b0101 1100
    z = ~0b10101100;	// z = 0b0101 0011

    z = x & y;		// z = 0b0010 0100
    z = x | y;		// z = 0b1011 1101
    z = x ^ y;		// z = 0b1001 1001
    z = ~x;		// z = 0b0101 0011

    z = x<<1;		// z = 0b0101 1000
    z = x>>3;		// z = 0b0001 0101

} // end main
</pre>

<h2>C relational operations</h2>
In the next lecture we will examine conditional statements; statements
allowing us to change the execution flow of a program based on the
results of operation.  Conditional statements use a True or False value
to determine which execution flow to follow.  Operations which produce
a True or False value are called relational operators.  In C, the
truth value True is associated with the integer value 1 and False
with the integer value 0.  Hence relational operators always evaluate
to 0 or 1 regardless of the inputs.

<pre>
void main(void) {

    uint8_t x = 172;
    uint8_t y = 53;
    uint8_t z = 0;

    // comments will contain variable values after expression is executed

    // What follows are some uncommon statements that I would not
    // expect to see in your (or my) programs from here on out.  They
    // are presented here to illustrate the evaluation of relational
    // operators.
    z = x > y;		// z = 1
    z = x >= y;		// z = 1
    z = x < y;		// z = 0
    z = x > 'a';	// z = 1 because 'a' is 97
    z = x > y;		// z = 1
    z = 1 == 0;		// z = 0
    z = 0 == 0;		// z = 1
    z = 0x0F == 0x00;	// z = 0
    z = 0x00 == 0x00;	// z = 1
} // end main
</pre>


Please be careful when using the equality check relational operation
"==".  It's very easy to overlook using a single equal sign and creating
a syntax error and an unintended assignment at worst (this is a tricky
bug to find).

<h2>C conditional logical operations</h2>
There are frequently cases when you need to change the execution flow
bases on more than one relational operation.  In such cases you need to
use a logical operation to combine two or more relational operations.
We will call these combinations conditional logical operations. We will 
use three conditional operations in our course, AND, OR and NOT,
represented using "&&", "||", and "!" respectively.<br><br>

It is a quirk of the C programming language that any non-zero value
is treated as TRUE and zero is FALSE.  So for example, 35 && 16 is
equivlent to TRUE && TRUE which is TRUE.  So the result of 
35 && 16 would be 1.  The following code provides some examples with 
these operators.

<pre>
void main(void) {

    uint8_t z = 0;

    // comments will contain variable values after expression is executed
    z = 1 && 1;		// z = 1
    z = 0 && 1;		// z = 0
    z = 1 || 0;		// z = 1
    z = 0 || 0;		// z = 0
    z = !0;		// z = 1
    z = !1;		// z = 0

    z = 0x0F && 0x0F;	// z = 1

<li>What happens when you increment an unsigned 8-bit variable x 
which is currently equal to 255? 
<!--
The variable x will equal 0 because the addition causes x to
"wrap around" to the next available integer.
-->

<li>Write an arithmetic expression that computes the radicand of
the quadratic formula.  That is the expression inside the square
root.  Assume that A,B and C are given as signed 16-bit values
and the radicand should also be signed 16-bit.  Make sure to 
include the variable declaration of the result.
<!--
    int16_t result;
    result = B*B - 4*A*C;
-->

<li>Write an arithmetic expression that computes the average of
4 values in the range [0,100].  The values are given in variables
A, B, C, and D.  Make sure to include the variable declaration of
the result.
<!--
    uint16_t result;			// Need 16-bit because we will add four 8-bit values first which could overflow an int8
    result = (A + B + C + D)/4;

-->

<li>If you tried to store the value 8,456,325 into an 8-bit variable,
what decimal value would end-up being stored in the variable?

<!--
Solution approach #1
8,456,325 = 0b 1000 0001 0000 1000 1000 0101, so only the least 
significant 8-bits, 0b10000101 would be stored.  This is equal to
133 in decimal.

Solution approach #2
8,456,325 / 256 = 33,032.51953125
This means that 8,456,325 goes around the 256 counting wheel 33,032
times, after which it is 0.51953125 of the way around.  Multiplying
this fraction by 256 will give us the value on the counting wheel.
256 * 0.51953125 = 133  So this is the value that will be stored
in the 8-bit variable.

-->

<li>Write an expression to keep only the least significant byte of
a 32-bit integer X and set all the other bits to 0.
<!--
    uint32_t result;
    result = X & 0x000000FF;
-->

<li>Write an expression to multiply a 16-bit integer X by 10 using
shifts and adds.
<!--
    uint32_t result;
    result =  (X << 3) + (X << 1);
-->

<li>Complete the Result column in the following table listing any
variable(s) that change as a result of the operation.  Your answers
should be in radix requested.   In some cases
there may be more than one variable that changes.  Assume that
the operands x, y, and z have type uint8_t.

Embedded C allows you to do some weird things that, as you gain
proficiency, can be used to great effect.  However, when starting out,
these powers will more than likely allow you to make some splendid
errors.  Lets explore a few of these.

<li>What is the initial value for the following variable declarations?
<pre>
    uint8_t a = 25;
    uint8_t b = 300;
    uint8_t c = 15793705;
    uint8_t d = -1
</pre>


<!--
There is nothing suspecious about the first declaration, a is set
equal to 25.
<br><br>

There is certianly a problem with the declaration of b as it's a
uint8_t and its range is 0 to 255.  Using the number wheel analogy,
the value for b is 300 mod 256, or just 300-256 since 300 only has 1
set of 256 in it.  This means that the initial value of b in our
program is 44.
<br><Br>

Well c is really way bigger than 256.  In this case I was fortunate
enough to have a "mod" operator on my calculator, otherwise I would
have to subracted <u>a lot</u> of sets of 256 in order to get the
8-bit value for c.  My calculator 15793705 mod 256 = 41.
<br><Br>

The 8-bit representation for -1 is 1111 1111.  When interperted as
an unsigned 8-bit value this is 255.  Thus the initial value of d
in our program is 255.
<br><br>

The C compiler will give you some evidence that there is something 
amiss with your program if you try these initialization.  I got the 
following three warnings in my program:
<pre>
arithmetic.c:40: warning: (751) arithmetic overflow in constant expression
arithmetic.c:42: warning: (751) arithmetic overflow in constant expression
arithmetic.c:43: warning: (751) arithmetic overflow in constant expression
</pre>

Moral of the story, keep an eye on those warnings, epsecially if your
code is doing something odd.
