<h1>Basic I/O</h1>
By now you should have a better understanding of the C programming
language, so it's time to put this knowledge to use.  We will start
with some examples of how to interact with simple input and output
devices in the form of an LED and push button.

<h2>I/O pins</h2>
It's well past time to examine the processor that you will be working
with for the remainder of the term, the PIC18F26K22.  The chip and the 
identities of its pins are listed in the figure below, taken from the
PIC18F26K22 Data Sheet.  Note that the PIC you soldered to the PCB came
in what is called a 28 pin small outline integrated circuit (28-SOIC)
package.

<br><img src="./img/pic18F26K22.jpg"><br><br>

Most of the pins are labeled "Rx#".  The letter R stands for "Register",
the "x" is the identity of the register and "#" is the bit withing that
port register.  So, for example, RC1 is bit 1 of the port C register.
Some of the registers have several names seperated with a "/" character.
These pins are 
<u>functionally multiplexed</u>, meaning that several internal functions
of the PIC are routed to the same pin.  For example, the pin labeled
"RB7/PGD" can be configured to be RB7 or the program data line (we will
explore what this means later).  Using an internal multiplexer,
your code will choose which of these functions is assocaiated with the
pin.  When a pin is configured as "Rx#", it is said to be configured
as a general purpose input output (GPIO).  Meaning that you can only 
read/write bits from/to that pin.  What the pin diagram above fails to 
communicate is that almost every pin on the PIC is functionally 
multiplex.  <br><br>

To appreciate all the options available to each pin you need to open up
the PIC18F26K22 Data Sheet, go to page 8 and look at Table 1 
(partially reproduced below).  To read this table, find the I/O pin you 
are interested in (From the leftmost 28-SOIC column)
and then go across that row to function the functions
mutiplex with that pin.  For example, pin 2 of the PIC18F26K22 is 
associated with I/O RA0, Analog AN0, and Comparator C12IN0-.
Note, that at a given instant in time, you can
have only one function associated with a pin.   At this time, there
are only two columns in Table 1 you are expected to understand, 
the pin number in the 28-SOIC column and the GPIO in the I/O column.
You should also note that these two columns are consistent with the
pin diagram above.

<br><img src="./img/pinMultiplex.jpg"><br><br>

Every port pin of the PIC (and for most GPIO microcontroller pins for 
that matter) has two configuration registers associated with it, a
data direction register (TRIS) and a port value register (PORT).
A data direction regsters determines if a pin is configured as
an input or an output.  Accessing the data direction bits is simplified
by the definitions in the "xc.h" include file
provided to you through the MPLAB X development environment. 
To access the data direction bit for a pin labeled "Rx#", use
"TRISxbits.TRISx#".  Note, "x" the port letter and "#" is
the bit within that port.  Setting a TRIS bit makes the associated pin an 
input (the number "1" is shaped like the letter "i" in the word "input"), 
clearing the bit makes the pin an output
(the number "0" is shaped like the letter "o" in the word "output").
So for example to make pin 
2 of the PIC18F26K22, which is RA0, an output you would use the statement 
"TRISAbits.TRISA0 = 0;" in your code.  
You can read a value from a pin labeled "Rx#" using "PORTxbits.Rx#".
You can write a value to a pin labeled "Rx#" using "LATxbits.LATx#".
So for example, if you wanted to write a logic 1 to pin 2, RA0,
after making it an output, you would use the statement 
"LATAbits.LATA0 = 1;"
<br><br>
When working with input pins that are functionally multiplex with
analog to digital converter channels (Analog column in Table 1 above)
<u>you must configure inputs to be digital by clearing the associated
analog select bit</u>.  An input is configured to be a digital input when
its associated analog select bit is cleared (assigned 0).  This will
be done in the code snippet below.
<br><br>

Putting this all together, the following is an simple example program
to configure two of the PIC pins.  We will configure the data direction
bits, read a value from RA0 and write a value to RA1.

<pre> 
    ANSELAbits.ANSA2 = 0;	// Inputs multiplex with ADC need digitized
    TRISAbits.TRISA2 = 1;	// setting the TRIS bit makes RA2 an input

    if (PORTAbits.RA2 == 1) printf("RA2 is at logic 1\r\n");
</pre>

Each of the PORT, TRIS and LAT registers is associated with 



One final point involves the translation between logical values inside
your program and the physical values present on the pins.  Your programs
will operate with 1's and 0's.  In the real world outside your program
and the PIC, these logical values correpond to 3.3V and 0V.  When you
configure a pin as an input, the PIC will classify a range of voltages
as logic levels.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Voltage Range		<td>Classified logic values	<td>Parameter
<tr><td>0V to 0.5V		<td>Logic 0		<td>V<sub>IL</sub>
<tr><td>1.7V to 3.3V		<td>Logic 1		<td>V<sub>IH</sub>
</table>
These values were obtained from the DC Characteristics table in
section 27.8 (page 441) of the PIC18F26K22 Data Sheet.
