<h1>Embedded Software Architectures</h1>
The architectures are driven by the need for response time.
<ul>
<li>Round-Robin (or superloop).
<li>Round-Robin with interrupts
<li>Non-preemptive Real-Time Operating System
<li>Preemptive Real-Time Operating System</h3>
</ul>

<h3>Round-Robin (or superloop)</h3>
A main loop checks each of the I/O devices and services each in a 
prescribed order.
<pre>
void main() {
    init();
    while(1) {
	task1();
	task2();
	...
}   }
</pre>

<b>Example</b>
A digital multimeter which checks the position of a switch, reads a value 
from a proble, performs an ADC conversion and then displays the result on 
an LCD is such an example.
<br><br>

<b>Advantage</b>
Works well when there are few I/O devices, no lengthy processing, 
and no tight response requirements.
<br><Br>

<b>Disadvantage</b>
If any device has a response time which is less than the time required
to get around the superloop.  If any of the tasks requires length 
processing.  Modification made to meet requirements results in a 
fragile architecture.

<h3>Round-Robin with interrupts</h3>
A main loop checks each of the I/O devices and services each in a 
prescribed order.  Interrupts are used to deal with the time 
constrained I/O devices.

<pre>
int8 data_for_device_A;

void main() {
    init();
    while(1) {
	task1();
	task2();
	...
	if (global_flag_A) taskA();
}   }

void ISR_deviceA() {
    service_A(data_for_device_A);
    set(global_flag_A);
}
</pre>

<b>Example</b>
36 position rotary encoder which selects which function to perform 
on a DS1302 real time clock.  Assume that it takes 100mS to read the
time from the DS1302.  We assume that we want to be able to monitor the
rotary encoder when it is turned slower than 1 rotation per second.  
This means that we must examine the rotary encoder at least 
36 clicks/sec * 4 detents / click = 144 detents / sec or 7mS / detent.  
Thus, we need to put either the DS1302 or the rotart encoder onto an 
interrupt so that we can perform both tasks.
<br><br>

<b>Advantage</b>
Simple.
<br><br>

<b>Disadvantage</b>
Open to problems associated with shared data.  All the tasks in main
operate with the same priority.  For example, a laser printer spends
lots of time calculating where to put the tiny dots of ink.  Main would
then get "stuck" working on this task at the exclusion of all the other
tasks.  Moving the other tasks into ISRs is a solution, but then a low
priority interrupt might take to long to service.  In addition, if there
were a pair of time consuming tasks then one of them would always have
to wait for the other.


<h3>Shared Data Problem</h3>
As soon as we use interrupts to share information between an ISR and
main we can create problems.  The foundation for these problems arises
from the fact that we don't want the ISR to perform all the work.
Generally, we use the ISR to manipulate some I/O device and pass
all the work of actually processing the information from the sensor
to main.<br><br>

The problems that can arise from sharing data between an ISR and
main are shown in the following code snippet.  In this example we
are to monitor the temperature from two sensors and set off an
alarm if these are different (we are to assume that this condition
indicates that there is a problem with the sensors that someone needs
to know about).

<pre>
int8 iTemp[2];

void interrupt ReadTemp(void) {
    iTemp[0] = ReadSensor0;
    iTemp[1] = ReadSensor1;
}

void main(void) {
    int8 iTemp0, iTemp1;

    while(1) {
        iTemp0 = iTemp[0];
        iTemp1 = iTemp[1];
        if (iTemp0 != iTemp1)
            Set off the klaxon;
}   }
</pre>

So where is the error?  Well it arises out of a sequence of events.
<ol>	<li>The temperature is changing.
	<li>We have just finished executing the "iTemp0..." line in main
	<li>The interrupt occurs and updates both values of iTemp[]	</ol>

The alarm will sound even though there was no real error.  Even worse this
error will <u>not</u> be repeatable.  This is a instance of a so-called
Heisenberg.  How about trying the following fix?
<pre>
int8 iTemp[2];

void interrupt ReadTemp(void) {
    iTemp[0] = ReadSensor0;
    iTemp[1] = ReadSensor1;
}

void main(void) {
    int8 iTemp0, iTemp1;

    while(1) {
        if (iTemp[0] != iTemp[1])
            Set off the klaxon;
}   }
</pre>

Well this really doesn;t work either.  So how to we solve this problem.
Well go the source.  The interrupt is the real culprit, if it
occurs when we are making the comparison then we can get a problem.
The solution will consist of making a "critical section" around the
comparison, not allowing interrupts to occur.
<pre>
int8 iTemp[2];

void interrupt ReadTemp(void) {
    iTemp[0] = ReadSensor0;
    iTemp[1] = ReadSensor1;
}

void main(void) {
    int8 iTemp0, iTemp1;

    while(1) {
	disable_interrupts();
        iTemp0 = iTemp[0];
        iTemp1 = iTemp[1];
	enable_interrupts();
        if (iTemp0 != iTemp1)
            Set off the klaxon;
}   }
</pre>


<h3>Interrupt Latency</h3>
If we enable and disable interrupts to solve the problems associated
with the shared data problem then we will increase the <u>interrupts
latency; the time delay between the occurrence of an interrupting
event and its being serviced.</u>  In some cases you will need to
calculate the latency, so how can you do this?  You need to know
4 things.

<ol>
<li>The longest period of time that the interrupt is disabled.
<li>The length of time required to service interrupts at a higher
priority level.
<li>The time required to enter an ISR.  This is MCU book-keeping
required to save the state of the MCU so that its not perturbed by
the ISR.
<li>How long if takes the ISR to set itself up and then "service"
the interrupting event.
</ol>

Lets look at an example
<ol>
<li>You have to disable interrupts for 125us for your task code 
to use a pair of temperature variables it shares with the
interrupt routine that reads the temperatures from the hardware and
writes them into the variables.
<li> You have to disable interrupts for 250us for your task code to 
get the tie variables from variables it shares with the interrupt routine that
responds to the timer interrupt.
<li>It takes 10us for the PIC to switch contexts.
<li>You must complete a response within 625us when you get a special 
signal (an interrupt) from another processor in your system; the 
inter-processor interrupt routine takes 300us to complete.
</ol>

This solution assumes that the inter-process communication is given
the highest priority and there are no other interrupts with that 
interrupt priority.  Always work these types of problems assuming
a worst-case scenario from the current state of the MCU to the resolution
of the interrupt.  That is assume that we have just entered the
portion of the foreground code which disables the interrupts.  Interrupts 
are disabled for 250us, it takes 10us to switch to the inter-process ISR, 
and inter-process communications require 300us.  Thus it takes 560us to
service this requires, well within the 625us requirement.  What if we
assumed that all the interrupts were of the same priority?


<h3>Real Time Operating Systems</h3>
A RTOS allows a collection of independent tasks to simultaneously
use the MCU.  A task are small embedded systems programs with a 
superloop structure.  Tasks have a priority which determines
their relative importance to one another.  Since we have only
one processor, we know that only one of the tasks can actually be
running at a time.  Hence, the tasks will have to be in variety
of states.
<ul>	<li>Task - A sequence of instructions to perform some action.
	<li>Interrupt - An external event which cause the ISR to run.
	<li>Task priority - A tasks importance relative to the other tasks.
	<li>Task switch - is the process of suspended one task and
		starting another.
	<li>Preemption - occurs when a task is interrupted to start another.
	<li>Kernel - The software system managing the switching of tasks.
	<li>delay - The amount of time that a tasks execution is suspended.
	<li>event - an occurrence that a task can wait for.
	<li>timeout - The amount of time that an event is willing to wait
		for an event.  Timeouts are optional.
	<li>Task state	<ul>
<li><b>Running </b>- the MCU is executing this task.  A running task will
puts itself into the blocked state if waits on an event or another
task with higher priority becomes unblocked.

<li><b>Ready</b> - Another task is running but this task has things that it 
could do if the MCU became available.  The scheduler moves a task
from the ready to the running state.

<li><b>Blocked</b> - the task does not have anything to do.  Tasks get into 
this state because they are waiting for some external event.  
<ul>

<li>A task will only enter the blocked state because it decides for itself 
that it has run out of useful things to do.  Other tasks in the system or 
the scheduler cannot decide for a task that it needs top wait for 
something. As a consequence of this, a task had to be running just 
before it is blocked.  It has to execute the instruction that figures 
out that there 's nothing else to do.  
<li>While a task is blocked it never get the CPU.  Therefore, some other
task must signal that whatever the task was waiting for has happened.
Otherwise the task will be blocked forever. This inter-task signaling
is usually accomplished using semaphore.
</ul>
</ul>

<li>Inter-Task communication -
In order for the tasks of a RTOS application to perform meaningful
work they must communicate with one another.  In order to avoid
the shared data problem, some
form of mutual exclusion must be implemented.  This is done using
semaphores - a true/false variable which can be set by a task, and
can be waited on by a task. An example of semaphores can be found 
in the fairy tale application.
<pre>
void taskCow() {
    while(1) {
		WaitForEvent(semaphoreFullMoon);
		JUMP_OVER_MOON();
		SignalEvent(semaphoreGreenCheese,1);
}   }
</pre>

The "WaitForEvent" function blocks the Cow task until the semaphore
"semaphoreFullMoon" goes true.  A semaphore is used only once and
then it has to be reset.  Several task could be waiting for the
same semaphore, in which case all of then would get to use it once
when it was set.  While waiting for "semaphoreFullMoon" to be set,
the cow task is blocked.  After being unblocked the cow task is
put into the ready state which will cause it to be run sometime
soon. When it runs it will call the JUMP_OVER_MOON function which
will then allow it to signal the "semaphoreGreeCheese" function.
The cow task would then go back to waiting for the next full moon.

<li>Scheduler - 
The scheduler is part of the kernel which keeps track of each 
tasks state and decides which one should be put into the running 
state.  Generally, the highest priority task gets the MCU.  If you 
write a RTOS application in which one task gets to hog the MCU and 
all the lower priority tasks have to wait; the scheduler assumes 
that you knew what you were doing when you set the task priorities.
</ul>

<h3>Non-preemptive Real Time Operating System</h3>
<b>Advantage</b>
Simple to write a non-preemptive RTOS.  Simple to program applications.
<br><Br>

<b>Disadvantage</b>
The longest delay to service a high priority event is the time required
by the longest task.  The RTOS cannot preempt any running task.  Consequently
a bug in one task may very well bring the entire system down.  Using
an RTOS consumes system resources (memory and MCU processing time).

<h3>Preemptive Real-Time Operating System</h3>
A preemptive RTOS can suspend one task to run another.
<br><br>

<b>Advantage</b>
The response time of the system is stable if the code is changed.
<br><Br>

<b>Disadvantage</b>
Using an RTOS consumes system resources (memory and MCU processing time).
They increase the delivery cost of your product.
