<h1>Timer Capture</h1>
We have now examined two important components of the timer subsystem,
the 16-bit counter and compare modules.  The compare module looks for
a match between TMRx and a value stored in CCPx.  We now introduce a 
timer capability that allows you to capture the timer when a 
prescribed event occurs on the associated pin.  This is the capture
feature and is schematically represented in the figure below.


<br><img src="./img/picTimerCapture.bmp"><br>
The timer subsystem, adapted from Figure 14-1 on page 174 of the 
PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet<br><br>

<h2>Capture Subsystem</h2>
The capture subsystem captures the value of TMRx when some 
prescribed event occurs on the associated pin.  Let's start
our discussion with the pin itself. Each capture/compare
module is associated with a single pin given in the following
table:
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>CCP module	<td>Pin
<tr><Td>CCP1		<td>RC2
<tr><Td>CCP2		<td>RC1 (or RB3)
<tr><Td>CCP3		<td>RB5 (or RC6)
<tr><Td>CCP4		<td>RB0
<tr><Td>CCP5		<td>RA4
</table>

In order to configure the capture function of the capture/compare subsystem,
we need to configure the Mode Select bits in the CCPx control register. 

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>CCPxM	<td>Configuration
<tr><td>0b0100	<td>Capture on every falling edge
<tr><td>0b0101	<td>Capture on every rising edge
<tr><td>0b0110	<td>Capture on every 4th falling edge
<tr><td>0b0111	<td>Capture on every 16th falling edge
</table>

The assignment of timer TMRx to Capture/Compare channel CCPx is accomplished
with the CCP timer selection control register 0 (page 200 of the
PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet) called CCPTMRS0. 
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>CxTSEL	<td>Timer
<tr><td>0b00	<td>CCPx module uses TMR1
<tr><td>0b01	<td>CCPx module uses TMR3
<tr><td>0b10	<td>CCPx module uses TMR5
<tr><td>0b11	<td>Reserved
</table>

This means that if you are using the CCP1 module and set CCP1M = 0b0100;
and C1TSEL=0b00; then the every falling edge (transition from logic 1 to 
logic 0) will cause the current TMR1 value to be stored in CCP1.
<br><br>

In addition, when configuring the capture/compare subsystem in the
capture mode, the associated pin should be configured as an input.
<br><br>

To see how these concepts can be applied to the solution of practical 
problems we will examine a device to determine the RPM of an engine 
and the second to determine the muzzle velocity of a projectile.

<h2>Quadrature Encoder</h2>
Imagine we are working in an application that has some moving mechanisms.
Our system issues commands to move the mechanism by a finite amount.  In
many applications, the resulting movement will contain some amount of
error.  In applications where this uncertiantity is unacceptable, we 
need some feedback mechanism that tells the us how much the system actually
moved.  One popular feedback mechanism is a quadrature encoder or
quad encoder for short.  A quad encoder is a 2-channel sensor that provides
directional as well as positional feedback.  In other words, a 
quad-encoder tells you which direction the mechanism moved and by how much.  
A mechanical quad encoder is easily built from an a specially etched
copper disk and a pair of contacts forming a pair of normally open 
switches shown in the yellow box in the schematic below.  A pair of
10k&ohm; resistors pulls the switch outputs high.  The internal mechanical
operation of a mechanical quad encoder produces a lot of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">switch 
bouncing</a> which is surpressed in this circuit with a pair of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter#RC_filter">low-pass 
filters</a> (formed by a 10k&ohm; and 0.01&micro;F) in front of the signal 
output.

<br><img src="./img/enc_sch.gif"><br>


The 2 channels 
are frequenty called A and B.  Both A and B are 50% duty cycle square waves.
Each period of A or B corrsponds to some known amount of movement
of the mechanism.  The sqaure waves on channels A and B have the same
frequency but are out-of-phase by 90&deg.  The channel which has its
positive edge 90&deg before the other channel's positive edge is said 
to lead.  The image below shows two examples of the channels leading 
each other.

<br><img src="./img/quadEncode.jpg"><br>
Taken from National Semiconductors "How Do I Use a Quadrature Encoder
with My Data Acquisition Board?"<br><Br>

If each pulse on a channel represents a known amount of movement, then
the speed of the mechanism is proportional to the number of pulses
per unit time.  More pulses in a unit of time means the mechanism is
moving faster.  Fitting more pulses in a unit of time means that the
period of the pulses must be shorter.  Thus, if we can measure the
duration of the pulses, we can determine the speed of the mechanism.
<br><br>

Lets measure the speed of a DC motor that we will use in our next lab,
Polou micro metal gearmotor.  This motor is connected to the
<a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/1217">Pololu Wheel Encoder</a>.
I did some experiments driving the motor with different duty cycle
waveforms and looked at the duration of the pulses coming from the
wheel encoder to get the data in the table below.  Note, I only
looked at channel A; I didn't care about the direction of the
wheels rotation.

Let's assume that these encoder pulses are coming into RC2, write
a program that outputs the number of timer counts of the pulses.
<br><br>

The first thing that we need to do is to determine the timer prescaler.
Since the longest pulse that we intend to measure is 31 ms long, we 
should use a 1:8 prescler because the its maximum period is 32.8 ms.
<br><br>

The idea that I have for the code is to stick it in an infinite loop
so that it measures the pulse durations forever.  My code will first
look for a positive edge on RC2, record the start time, and then look for
a negative edge and record the end time of the pulse.

<pre>
    int16 start, end;

    TRISCbits.RC2 = 1;		// Make pin RC2 an input
    CCP1CONbits.CCP1M = 0b0101;	// Enable the capture channel 1 on rising edge
    CCPTMRS0bits.C1TSEL = 0b00; // Associate TMR1 with CCP1
    T1CONbits.T1CKPS = 0b11;    // 1:8 prescale
    T1CONbits.TMR1ON = 1;       // Turn on timer 1

    for(;;) {
    	CCP1CONbits.CCP1M = 0b0101;	// Capture on rising edge on RC2
	PIR1bits.CCP1IF = 0;            // CCPR1 register when a falling 
        while (PIR1bits.CCP1IF == 0);   // edge of RC2 is detected
        start = CCPR1;		

    
    	CCP1CONbits.CCP1M = 0b0100;	// Capture on falling edge on RC2
	PIR1bits.CCP1IF = 0;            // CCPR1 register when a falling 
        while (PIR1bits.CCP1IF == 0);   // edge of RC2 is detected
        end = CCPR1;		// 

	// speed = calculateSpeed(end - start);

    } 
</pre>

<li>Complete the speed calculation for the wheel.  That is,
given the number of 8:1 prescaled timer counts for a single 
pulse from a 12 spoke 43mm diameter wheel.  Note that there
are 12 spokes so there are 12 logic 1 pulses per wheel rotation.

<!--
The speed calculation is an interesting exercise in units factoring.
Channel A makes 12 wavelengths per rotation of its 43mm diameter wheel.
Our program above measures the number of 8:1 prescaled timer counts 
that go by during the positive half of this wavelength.  This is
enough information to perform the following dimensional analysis.

<pre>

1 pulse    1 count   16*10^6 clk    1 wave    1 rotation     135 mm
-------- * ------- * ----------- * -------- * ---------- * ----------
x counts    8 clks    1 second     2 pulses    12 waves    1 rotation

This works out to:
		 11,250,000 mm/sec              
                 ----------------- 
                        x         
</pre>

<li>
<b>Muzzle Velocity</b><br>
You are working on an Electromagnetic railgun and need an accurate 
method of determining the muzzle velocity.  To accomplish this goal
you setup a speed trap consisting of a pair of sensors placed 1 meter
apart.  The projectile, when fired, passes by the first sensor
sending a logic 1 pulse to PT0 and then passes by the second 
sensor a short while later producing a logic 1 pulse on PT1.  The
railgun is anticipated to have a muzzle velocity of 2,400 m/s.
Your tasks are to:

<ol type="a">
<li>Use a 1:1 prescaler, determine the number of counts between
a projectile moving between the two sensors at the anticipated
velocity.
<li>Write a code snippet that records the number of timer counts
for the projectile to move between the two sensors.  Use the
capture subsystem.
<li>Write an equation that relates the number of timer counts
to the projectile velocity.
</ol>

<!--
Lets first determine the number of counts that will go by as the
projectile moves from one sensor to the next.  We will use a 1:1
prescaler for now and adjust if the number of counts is greater
than 2<sup>16</sup>

<pre>
    16*10^6 clk   1 count     1 second       1 meter        6,667 count
    ----------- * ------- * ------------- * ----------- =  -------------
     1 second     1 clk     2,400 meters    1 detection     detection
</pre>

Since this number of counts is less than 2<sup>16</sup>, a 1:1 prescaler
will work in our applicaiton.

<pre>
    int16 start, end;

    TRISCbits.TRISC2 = 1;		// RC2 an input from first sensor
    CCP1CONbits.CCP1M =  0b0101;	// Capture on positive edge
    CCPTMRS0bits.C1TSEL = 0b00;		// Associate TMR1 with CCP1

    TRISCbits.TRISC1 = 1;		// RC2 an input from first sensor
    CCP2CONbits.CCP2M =  0b0101;	// Capture on positive edge
    CCPTMRS0bits.C2TSEL = 0b00;		// Associate TMR1 with CCP2

    T1CONbits.T1CKPS = 0b00;        	// 1:1 prescale
    T1CONbits.TMR1ON = 1;           	// Turn on timer 1

    PIR1bits.CCP1IF = 0; 
    PIR1bits.CCP2IF = 0;  

    
    while(PIR1bits.CCP1IF  == 0);	// Wait for rising edge on first sensor
    start = CCP1;			// 

    while( PIR1bits.CCP2IF == 0);	// Wait for rising edge on second sensor
    end  = CPP2;			// 

    // speed = convertCountsToSpeed(end-start);

    for(;;);			// Catch program in an infinite loop
</pre>

Finally, let's convert the timer counts into meters per second.  
To do this, let's suppose that it take x counts
for the projectile to move between the two sensors.  Using dimensional
analysis, we get:

<pre>
    16*10^6 clk   1 count    1 meter	16,000,000 meters
    ----------- * ------- *  -------  = -----------------
     1 second     1 clk      x counts       x seconds
</pre>

From this, if the projectile took 10,000 counts to move between the
sensors, the it would have a velocity of 1,600 meters/second which 
is consistent with our initial calculations.  Unfortunatly, in this
case we will need to use variables with type int32 as the constants
involved are much larger than the 2<sup>16</sup> range aforded by int16.

<li>
<b>RPM measurement</b><br>
Most modern car engines use computers to monitor and control almost
every major function in an engine.  Among the most important is
the timing of the spark which ignites the gas-air mixture inside
a cylinder.  If the spark occurs too early, the explosion inside the
cylinders will collide with the upward moving piston causing the 
engine to "knock".  If the spark occurs too late, the expanding gasses
from the explosion will not fully impart their energy into the piston
causing the engine to hesitate.  The timing of the spark is determined
in large part by the Hall-effect camshaft position sensor.  A small
magnet is embedded in the crankshaft that rotates in time with the 
moving pistons.  A Hall-effect sensor placed next to the crankshaft
nominally outputs logic 0, buts outputs a brief logic 1 pulse every 
time the magnet passes by.  These pulses are fed into the engine
control unit (ECU) which is running a PIC.  It's your job to write a
program which calculates the RPM for a crankshaft that rotates 
somewhere between 800 (lowest RPM before the engine stalls) and 
10,000 RPMs (when the rev-limiter kicks).  Your PIC is attached 
to the camshaft position sensor through RC2.  Your tasks are to:
<ol type="a">
<li>Determine the clock speed and prescaler necessary to measure engine RPMs.
<li>Write a code snippet to measure the number of timer counts
required for the camshaft to make a single rotation.
<li>Write an equation relating timer counts to RPMs.
</ol>

<!--
The first step in solving this problem is to determine the timer
configuration, meaning what prescaler is needed.  As a starting 
point, I used dimensional analysis to determine the number of 
non-prescaled clock occur during a single camshaft rotation.

<pre>
    16*10^6 clk   1 count   60 seconds       1 minute        96,000 counts
    ----------- * ------- * ---------- * ---------------- =  -----------
     1 second      1 clk     1 minute    10,000 rotations     rotation

    16*10^6 clk   1 count   60 seconds     1 minute       1,200,000 counts
    ----------- * ------- * ---------- * ------------- =  -------------
     1 second       clk      1 minute    800 rotations       rotation
</pre>

Clearly, both of these values are far larger than 2<sup>16</sup>,
so we will need a prescaler.  Looking at the two values, its clear
that the 800 RPM case will require more prescaling to bring it
inside 2<sup>16</sup>.  But just how much?  An easy way would be to 
divide 1,200,000 by powers of 2 until you find one which a quotient 
less than or equal to 2<sup>16</sup>.  I found that 1,200,000 / 32 =
37,500 which is the smallest prescaler that make the quotient less 
than 2<sup>16</sup>.  Unfortunatly, the PIC TMR1 (or TMR3 or TMR5)
modules have a maximum prescaler of 1:8.  So we will need to slow the
clock down.  We can use ratios to determine the maximum clock rate that
will still be able to measure the engine rotating at 800 RPMs using a 
1:8 prescaler.  

<pre>
	16,000,000 count/sec   X/8 clks/sec
	-------------------- = ------------		X <= 6.9 MHz.
	  1,200,000 counts    2<sup>16</sup> counts
</pre>
The largest frequency avaiable that is larger than this is 4MHz.
<br><Br>
Let's recalculate
<pre>
    4*10^6 clk   1 count   60 seconds       1 minute         3,000 counts
    ----------- * ------- * ---------- * ---------------- =  -----------
     1 second     8 clk     1 minute    10,000 rotations       rotation

    4*10^6 clk   1 count   60 seconds     1 minute        37,500 counts
    ----------- * ------- * ---------- * ------------- =  -------------
     1 second     8 clk      1 minute    800 rotations       rotation
</pre>


<pre>
    uint16_t pulseWidth, camshaftRPM, oldPulseCount;

    TRISCbits.TRISC2 = 1;		// Make RC2 an input from camshaft
    CCP1CONbits.CCP1M =  0b0101;	// Capture on rising
    CCPTMRS0bits.C1TSEL = 0b00;		// Associate TMR1 with CCP1
    PIR1bits.CCP1IF = 0;
    T1CONbits.T1CKPS = 0b11;		// 1:8 prescale
    T1CONbits.TMR1ON = 1;		// Turn on timer 1

    for(;;) {  
	while (PIR1bits.CCP1IF == 0);	// Wait for hall effect (rising edge)
	pulseWidth = CCP1 - oldPulseCount;	// current time - previous time
	oldPulseCount = CCP1;	// Store for the next camshaft rotation
	PIR1bits.CCP1IF = 0;	// Clear flag to capture next camshaft rotation
	// camshaftRPM = convertCountsToRPM(pulseWidth);	// TBD
  } // end infinite loop
</pre>

Our final problem is to convert the timer counts into RPMs.  Not 
surprisingly we will use dimensional analysis.

<pre>
    4*10^6 clk   1 count    1 rotation   60 seconds     30,000,000 
    ---------- * ------- *  ---------- * ----------  = ----------- RPMs
     1 second     8 clk     x counts      1 minute           x    
</pre>

That looks like a pretty big numerator, so let's make a reality check on our
answer.  In the earlier discussion, we calculated that 37,500 counts at
a 8:1 prescaler should correspond to 800 RPMs.  So lets plug this
information into our equation and see what we get.

<pre>
    30,000,000  rotations
    ----------- ---------  where x = 37,500 counts
          x     seconds

    30,000,000         
    ----------- = 800  RPM
      37,500            
</pre>

Spot frickin on.
