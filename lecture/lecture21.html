<h1>Analog to Digital Conversion</h1>

<h2>Aliasing</h2>
Whenever you sample an analog signal at discrete times, you are going 
to run into aliasing problems and frequency folding.  Let's examine
these concepts and develop some robust definitions. We will use the
term "ADC sample" to mean the act of an ADC generating a converted value
from its analog input.  In most applications, your ADC will sample its
input (and generate a converted value) at a regular period that we will
call the sampling rate. The following discussion concerns the sampling
rate, but not with the ADC resolution and the reference voltages. 
<br>

Imagine that you have an ADC that samples its input once every 50 us.
Every sample in the following figures is represented with a red dot.
Now let's apply a 2,500 Hz, 2 V peak-to-peak sine wave to the input 
of the ADC.  This waveform is shown in blue in the top graph.  Note
the horizontal axis has units of microseconds.

<br><img src="./img/2500Hz.jpg"><br><br>

The top graph shows which points along the sine wave are sampled
generating converted values on the ADC output.  Notice that the red
dots are found at 50 us interval along the time axis, consistent
with the fact that we are sampling the input once every 50 us. 
Furthermore, the period of the waveform is 400 us, which is a 
frequency of 1/400us = 2,500 Hz, consistent with the claimed
frequency of the input.  Now, if you wrote an embedded 
program to store these converted values in an 
array.  If you plotted these array values in excel you would get 
the lower graph. <u>Now imagine if you were presented with only
the data in the lower graph and were asked to provide a best guess
at the frequency of the sine wave that produced these points.</u>
I hope that the answer is obvious, it looks like a 2,500 Hz waveform
was responsible for generating the red points.  We will call this
the <u>observed frequency</u> of the sampled data.  Now for the twist,
there are an infinite number of different sine wave that could have
generated the red points.  That is, there are an infinite number of
sine waves that when sampled every 50 us, have an observed frequency
of 2,500 Hz.  These sine waves are the <u>alias</u> of the
2,500 Hz waveform.  Let's look at one such alias to better understand
what is going on.<br><br>

Again imagine that you have an ADC that samples its input once every 
50 us. Every sample in the following figures is represented with a 
red dot. Now let's apply a 22,500 Hz, 2 V peak-to-peak sine wave to 
the input of the ADC. This waveform is shown in blue in the top graph.
 Note the horizontal axis has units of microseconds. 


<br><img src="./img/22500Hz.jpg"><br><br>

The top graph shows which points along the sine wave are sampled 
generating converted values on the ADC output. Notice that the red 
dots are found at 50 us interval along the time axis, consistent with 
the fact that we are sampling the input once every 50 us. Furthermore, 
the period of the blue waveform is 44 us, which is a frequency of 
1/44us = 22,500 Hz, consistent with the claimed frequency of the 
input. It should be obvious that the red samples are not coming fast
enough to keep-up with the blue waveform.  This creates problems when
we try to provide a best guess at the frequency of the sine wave that 
produced these red points.  With the exception of a phase shift,
the red points in the lower graph are indistinguishable from the 
samples collected from the 2,500 Hz waveform.

Using this table of data, I've plotted the Observed Frequency vs. the 
Input Frequency in the graph below.  Notice the distinctive upside-down 
v-shape of the data points.  This pattern repeats itself, creating an 
infinite sequence of upside-down v-shape wedges.  The black line
connecting the points represents the actual graph of Observed Frequency
vs Input Frequency.  You might remember that this data was collected 
from an ADC sampling its input every 50 us.  When interpreted as a
frequency, 50 us produces a sampling frequency of 20,000 Hz. This 
value is so important, it is given its own special symbol
f<sub>s</sub>.  It is no coincident that the peak of the graph below
occurs at f<sub>s</sub>/2 and the valley at f<sub>s</sub>/2.

<br><img src="./img/alias.jpg"><br><br>

Imagine that you were interested in 2,500 Hz signals collected by this
ADC.  We have already seen that a 22,500 Hz sine wave has an observed 
frequency of 2,500 Hz and hence is an alias of 2,500 Hz.  Any other input
frequency which has an observed frequency of 2,500 Hz is also an alias.
In other words, all alias of 2,500 Hz lie along the horizontal line with
an observed frequency of 2,500 Hz.  These higher frequency alias are said
to <u>foldback</u> to the lowest frequency.<br><Br>

This creates a troubling problem for ADCs.  For any frequency of 
interest (like 2,500 Hz), there are an infinite number of (higher) 
input frequencies that, when sampled, are indistinguishable 
from this frequency of interest.  <br><br>

When describing alias, I will use the term harmonic to talk about
the individual v-shape regions on the Observed Frequency vs. 
Input Frequency graph.  The left-most v-shaped region is the 
first harmonic, and each subsequent v-shaped region a incrementally
higher harmonic.  With respect to the figure above, the first harmonic
has a frequency of 0Hz to 20kHz and the second harmonic has a frequency
of 20kHz to 40kHz.

<ul>
<li><b>Question:</b>An ADC is sampling a signal at 20kHz.  List the
first 8 alias of 2kHz?<br>
<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
1st harmonic:   2kHz                    20kHz-2kHz = 18kHz
2nd harmonic:   20kHz+2kHz=22kHz        40kHz-2kHz = 38kHz
3rd harmonic:   40kHz+2kHz=42kHz        60kHz-2kHz = 58kHz
4th harmonic:   60kHz+2kHz=62kHz        80kHz-2kHz = 78kHz
</pre>

<li><b>Question:</b>An ADC is sampling a signal at 30kHz, what 
frequencies will alias to 5kHz in the 100th harmonic?<br>
<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
100th harmonic: 99*30kHz+5kHz=2,965kHz    100*30kHz-5kHz = 3,005kHz
</pre>

<li><b>Question:</b>An ADC is sampling a signal at 50kHz, what 
frequency, closest to 2,430kHz, alias to 15kHZ?<br>
<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
	Let's find the start of the harmonic that is closest to 2,430kHz.
	2,430kHz / 50kHz = 48.6 
	50kHz * 49 = 2,450kHz is the closest start of a harmonic to 2,430kHz

	Subtracting 15kHZ from this frequency gives us an alias of 
	2,450kHz - 15kHz = 2,435kHz which is just 5kHz away from the 
	target frequency of 2,430kHz.
</pre>

</ul>

Now the real problem with aliasing is that energy from signals 
outside your range of interest can foldback into the frequencies
of interest.  For example, the second graph below shows a signal 
with two power peaks, one in the first harmonic and one in the 
second.  However, since aliasing happens, the power in the second
harmonic will foldback into the first harmonic creating unwanted
noise.
<br><img src="./img/LowPassFilter.GIF"><br><br>


<h2>Attenuation</h2>
In order to address this problem we will utilize a principle
called attenuation.  Attenuation is the process of changing the
amplitude of a waveform without changing its frequency.  Specifically,
we will examine how to use a low-pass filter (LPF) to reduce the power 
from the higher order harmonics so that when its foldback into the
first harmonic, it will not have enough power to create a noticeable
amount of noise.<br><br>

Before we start on the design of LPF, you need to master the concept
of Decibels (dB) which will describe the amount of signal attenuation
provided by an electronic component.  Attenuation referrers to changing 
the amplitude of a waveform from input (Called V<sub>in</sub>) to output 
(called V<sub>out</sub>) as it travels through the electronics component.  

<pre>
	dB = 20 * log (V_out/V_in)
</pre>

Note that the equation for Decibels uses a base 10 logarithm.

<li><b>Question:</b>
If a electronic component took a 1v sine wave as input
and output a 0.1v sine wave, how much attenuation would it have?<br>
<b>Answer:</b>

<pre>
	dB = 20 * log (0.1/1.0) = -20 dB
</pre>

<li><b>Question:</b>
Suppose an electronic component had a 1 v sine wave as input and produced
a 10v sine wave as output.  How much attenuation would it impart on the 
signal?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
	dB = 20 * log (10/1.0) = 20 dB
</pre>


<li><b>Question:</b> If you input a 3 V sin wave into a circuit
that attenuated it by -40dB, what would the amplitude of the 
output waveform be?<br>
<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>

	-40 dB = 20 log (V<sub>out</sub>/3 V)
	V<sub>out</sub> = 
</pre>


<li><b>Question:</b> If you input a 3 V sin wave into a circuit
how many dB of attenuation would you need to reduce the amplitude
to 0.1 V?
<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
	Attenuation	= 20 log (0.1 V /3 V)
			= 
</pre>

<li><b>Question:</b> A circuit attenuates an input signal by 
-68 dB to produce a 0.5 V signal.  What is the amplitude of
the input signal?
<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
	-68 dB = 20 log (0.5 V /V<sub>in</sub>)
	V<sub>in</sub> = 
</pre>

<li>An ADC is sampling a signal at 50kHz.  List the
first 7 alias of 3.5kHz?
<!--
<pre>
1st harmonic:          3.5kHz                  50kHz-3.5kHz =  46.5kHz
2nd harmonic:    50kHz+3.5kHz= 53.5kHz        100kHz-3.5kHz =  96.5kHz
3rd harmonic:   100kHz+3.5kHz=103.5kHz        150kHz-3.5kHz = 146.5kHz
4th harmonic:   150kHz+3.5kHz=153.5kHz        200kHz-3.5kHz = 196.5kHz
</pre>
-->

<li>An ADC is sampling a signal at 50kHz, what frequencies will alias 
to 8kHz in the 42th harmonic?  
<!--
<pre>
42th harmonic: 41*50kHz-8kHz    42*50kHz+8kHz
</pre>
-->

<li>An ADC is sampling a signal at 100kHz, what 
frequency, closest to 1,380kHz, alias to 15kHZ?<br>
<!--
<pre>
	Let's find the start of the harmonic that is closest to 1,380kHz.
	1,380kHz / 100kHz = 13.8
	100kHz * 14 = 1,400kHz is the closest start of a harmonic to 1,380kHz

	Subtracting 15kHZ from this frequency gives us an alias of 
	1,400kHz - 15kHz = 1.385MHz which is just 5kHz away from the 
	target frequency of 1,380kHz.

	So the answer is 1.385MHz

<li>If you input a 1v sin wave into a circuit
that attenuated it by -68dB, what would the amplitude of the 
output waveform be?<br>
<!--
<pre>
	-68 dB = 20 log(V<sub>out</sub>/1 V)
	V<sub>out</sub> = 398uV
</pre>
-->

<li>If you reduced a signal by a factor of 1/256,
how many dB would you need to attenuate it by?<br>
<!--
<pre>
	20 log(1/256) = -48dB

<li>You're sampling an analog signal at 48kHz. List all the frequencies 
in the first 3 harmonics that alias to  2kHz signals. 

<!--
<pre>
1st harmonic:	2kHz			48kHz-2kHz = 46kHz
2st harmonic:	48kHz+2kHz=50kHz	96kHz-2kHz = 94kHz
3st harmonic:	96kHz+2kHz=98kHz	144kHz-2kHz = 142kHz
</pre>
-->


<li>A first-order LPF has a cutoff frequency of 2kHz. Describe the 
attenuation of a 80kHz input signal in decibels and as a ratio of 
output voltage to input voltage. 

<!--
Since a decade is a multiplicative factor of 10, we need to find how
may powers of 10 you have to multiply by in order to increase 2 to 80.
In other words…
<pre>
2*10^x = 80, solving for X yields
x = log_10(80/2) = 1.6
</pre>

So we know that a 80kHz waveform is 1.6 decades above the 2kHz corner
frequency.
Since the LPF attenuates -20db/decade, the 80kHz waveform will be attenuated
1.6*-20 = -32db  Decibels can be converted to the ratio of output/input
using its definition...
<pre>
-32db = 20db log_10(V_out/V_in)
V_out/Vin = 0.025 = 1/40
</pre>
