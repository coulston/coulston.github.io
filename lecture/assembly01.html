<h2>Programmers Model & Assembly Instructions</h2>
This PIC is an accumulator based machine, meaning all data-computations 
manipulate a special register called the accumulator, or in the PICs case
the "working" or W register.  Clearly, complex calculations will require more
than a single place to put data, hence the PIC has a data RAM, called the
"File Registers" or F register in the PICs case.  Will will start our
exploration of the PICs assembly language by examining the "BYTE-ORIENTED 
FILE REGISTER OPERATIONS" on page 376 of the datasheet.  For the
most part these instructions will manipulate the contents of the W register
or one of the F "registers". 

PIC assembly mnemonics are always read from left to right, like an English
sentence.  The letter "f" in the assembly language instructions is a 
supposed to be a number between 0x00 and 0x7F which is the address of 
the file register being manipulated.  The letter "d" determines the 
destination of the operation.
If d=0 then the result of the operation is put into the W register.  
If d=1 then the result of the operation is put into the f register.  
Normally, an include file is associated with your programs which
equates d=0 with the letter "w" and
equates d=1 with the letter "f" so that you do not have to remember
this arbitrary numerical assignment.
<br><br>

<h2>Operations on datatypes</h2>
When programming in assembly, you quickly come to terms with the notion
that everything that you want to describe must be done in bits.  In this
respect you can create any datatypes you want in assembly.  However, 
the operations on datatypes are a different matter entirely.  
The only datatypes understood by the PIC microcontroller's,
instructions, called native datatypes, are boolean, unsigned 8-bit, and 
signed 8-bit values.  Operations on other, non-native, datatypes like 
ASCII, 32-bit integers, and floating points must be described by software 
routines written using the native dataypes.
<br><br>

When writing an assembly program, you will need to be able to reference
the places in memory where you have stored variables.  The PIC assembly
language provides two means to achieve this goal:
<ul>	<li><b>EQU</b> - explicitly declaring the address to store the variable
	<li><b>RES</b> - allowing the assembler to determine the address to 
			store the variable. 
</ul>
Both methods are described below.
<pre>
explicitVar	EQU	0x20
autoVar		RES	2
</pre>

The first line states that you will be storing the variable "explicitVar"
at RAM address hexadecimal 0x10.  The second line tells the assembler to
carve out 2 bytes of data memory at a location of its choosing. 
Any reference to "autoVar" in the program will be replaced with the address
the assembler has choosen.  
<br><br>

The first method is fine for simple programs where you do not have many 
variables to keep track of.  In fact the "EQU" statement can be used
anytime that you want to have a string name for a constant.  Say you are
building a music box to play a song with 45 notes.  You might have the
statement <font face="courier">SONG_LEN	EQU	45</font> in your
program.  The second method of reserving space in data memory is 
prefered for several reasons:
<ul>	<li>If a variable is remvoed from your program, the existing ones
		are moved around in data memory to accomidate,
	<li>If new variables are added to your program, the existing ones
		are moved around in data memory to accomodiate,
	<li>there is no risk of your overlapping two variables.
</ul>

<h2>Assembly arithmetic operations</h2>
The most familiar type of operations are those that you learned 
early in elementary school, arithmetic operations.  Let's look at 
a C-code example consisting of variable declarations and expressions
and re-interpret them into PIC assembly language.  These examples
are very similar to arithmetic expression formed in Lecture 02.
You should notice that,
<ul>	<li>comments start with a semicolon 
	<li>mnemonics do not start in the first column
	<li>operands are all vertically aligned 
</ul>

<h3>Operation between Literal and File Register</h3>
Whenever are performing an operation between a literal and
a variable in memory and storing the result back in a different
memory location, we will always use a three step illustrated in
the following figure.
<ul>	<li>Step 1: Move the literal into the W register
	<li>Step 2: Perform the operation and store the result into W
	<li>Step 3: Move W into the destination register.
<br><img src="./img/fileWithLiteral.bmp"><br><Br>

<h3>Operation between File Register and File Register</h3>
Whenever are performing an operation between two variables
store in the file registers and storing the result back in a different
memory location, we will always use a three step illustrated in
the following figure.
<ul>	<li>Step 1: Move the variable into the W register
	<li>Step 2: Perform the operation and store the result into W
	<li>Step 3: Move W into the destination register.
<br><img src="./img/fileWithFile.bmp"><br><Br>

Note that when one of the source variables is the same as the 
destination variable this 3 step process can be reduced to 2
steps.  For example, you can perform the operation
<font face="courier">x = x + y;</font> in 2 instructions as follows:

<pre>
	;  x = x + y;	
	MOVF	Y8, W		; W <- M[Y8]
	ADDWF	X8, F		; M[X8] <- M[X8] + W
</pre>

Here the "F" in the "ADDWF" instruction instructs the
PIC to store the result of the add back into the named file 
register - in this case X8.  The use of "F" can sometimes simplify
your assembly programs.

<h2>Assembly bitwise logical operations</h2>
Bitwise logical operations perform the familiar AND, OR, XOR and NOT 
operations on variable, by performing the logical operations on pairs 
of bits in the same bit-position in each operand.  We often use bitwise
logical operations to mask portions of a variable, hiding certain 
bit-positions of the variable from the effects of an operation. 

<pre>
	;****************************************************
	;  C logic operations - Lecture 02
	;****************************************************	
	MOVLW	B'10101100'
	MOVWF	X8	
	MOVLW	B'00110101'
	MOVWF	Y8
	CLRF	Z8
	
	;  z = x & 0x0F;	z = 0b0000 1100
	MOVLW	0x0F		; W <- 0x0F
	ANDWF	X8, W		; W <- W & M[X8]	
	MOVWF	Z8		; M[Z8] <- W

	;  z = x | y;		z = 0b101 1110
	MOVF	Y8,W		; W <- M[Y8]		
	IORWF	X8, W		; W <- W | M[X8]	
	MOVWF	Z8		; M[Z8] <- W			
	
	; z = x ^ 0x0F;		z = 0b1010 0011
	MOVLW	0x0F		; W <- 0x0F
	XORWF	X8, W		; W <- W ^ M[X8]	
	MOVWF	Z8		; M[Z8] <- W	    
	
	; z = ~x;		z = 0b0101 0011
	COMF	X8, W		; W <- ~M[X8]
	MOVWF	Z8		; M[Z8] <- W

	; z = x<<1;		z = 0b0101 1000
	BCF	STATUS, C	; clear carry bit
	RLCF	X8, W		; rotate X8 left with carry bit into LSB into W
	MOVWF	Z8		; M[Z8] <- W
 
	; z = x>>3;		z = 0b0001 0101	
	MOVF	X8, W
	MOVWF	Z8		; M[Z8] <- M[X8]
	BCF	STATUS, C	; clear carry
	RRCF	Z8		; rotate right with 0 into MSB (logical SR)
	BCF	STATUS, C	; again
	RRCF	Z8
	BCF	STATUS, C	; again
	RRCF	Z8
</pre>

With the exception of shift operations, these operations follow the 
same pattern used for arithmetic operations.  The PIC is a little
unusual in microcontrollers because it exclusively uses a circular 
shift operation.  We are using the variation that puts the carry
bit into the loop as shown in the following figure.

<br><img src="./img/shift.bmp"><br><br>

Probably 90% of the time that someone wants a shift operation, they
are asking to perform a logical shift.  This means that they want a 
"0" placed in the vacated bit position.  However in a normal circular 
shift the bit that is shifted off the end off the register is placed in 
vacancy created at the other end of the register.  However using the
"RLCF" instruction, the carry bit is put into this loop as shown in
the figure above.  Consequently, my code clears this "C" bit prior
to the shift operation to ensure that a "0" is always placed in the
vacancy created, creating a logical shift.

<pre>
BCF	STATUS, C	; clear carry bit
RLCF	X8, W		; rotate X8 left with carry bit into LSB into W
</pre>

<h3>Static evaluation</h3>
The PIC assembler will make every effort to compute any the value of an
operation before it generates the final machine code.  Operations which
are performed <u>prior</u> to generating the downloaded code are called
static evaluations.  The word static means that the evaluation is performed
on values that cannot change - they are static (lacking motion).
<br><br>

One example of static evaluation are mathematic expression related to 
addresses.  For example, consider the following assembly instruction:
<pre>
	MOVF	varX8+1, w
</pre>
The assembler running on the PC will find the address asscicated with 
"varX8" and the PC will add 1 to it and use the resulting value as the
file register address for the MOVF instruction.

<li>Go through the assembly code contained in pic02.asm - I will 
ask you about this on the second exam.

<li>Perform the C operation varZ8 = 3*(varX8 + varY8);  You should assume that
space for these variables has already been reserved.  You can do this 
without a temporary variable.
<!--

<li>A linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is a general techanique that
has been used with great success in generating pseudo-random number.
A pseudo-random number generator starts with a seed valuye (any non-zero
number) and generates a sequence of numbers that look like they have
no relationship to one another.  To generate a sequence of pseudo-random
16-bit numbers using an LFSR with current varX16.  To do this:
<ul>
<li>Step 1: xor the bits in positions 15,13,12,10 and 0 (start indexing your bits starting at position 0),  
<li>Step 2: shift varX16 left one bit,
<li>Step 3: put the xor bit into the LSB of varX16.
</ul>
