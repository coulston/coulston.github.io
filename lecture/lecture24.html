<h1>Analog to Digital Conversion</h1>

<h2>Passive Low Pass Filter</h2>
A passive low pass filter can be built from a resistor and capacitor
arranged in the configuration shown below.

<br><img src="./img/passiveLPF.jpg"><br><br>

This is a first order filter with the following characteristics.

<ul>	<li>Corner frequency: f<sub>c</sub> = 1/(2*pi*R*C) 
	<li>DC Gain: 1
	<li>Roll-off slope: -20dB/decade
</ul>


<h2>Active Low Pass Filter</h2>
The main drawback of a passive filter is that it loads the signal
source with its impedance.  An active filter decreases this burden
and in most cases produces better results.  
Designing an active low pass filter can be a little overwhelming as
their are a variety of topologies (arrangements of electronics circuit
elements), filter types (Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Bessel to 
name a few), and op-amps.  A complete study of these alternatives would 
be a course in itself, so you will have to be satisfied with this brief 
overview.<br>

Probablly the most common active filter is shown below, 
a 2<sup>ond</sup> order Sallen-Key filter.
Note that is has a pair RC elements, each serving the
role of a single first order low-pass filter.

<br><img src="./img/lpfEagle.jpg"><br><Br>

This filter does not have overwhelming performance, but makes up for
that in its predictiable performance given in the following list.

<ul>	<li>Corner frequency: f<sub>c</sub> = 1/(2*pi*SQRT(R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub> C<sub>1</sub> C<sub>2</sub>)) 
	<li>DC Gain: 1
	<li>Roll-off slope: -40dB/decade
</ul>

Frequently designers will set 
R<sub>1</sub> = R<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>2</sub> with the
effect of simplifying the design.  Furthermore, if possible the resistance
should be set between 1k and 10k&#8486;.  This produces the following Bode
plot.

<br><img src="./img/secondOrder.jpg"><br><br>

The choice of op-amps is not terriably important for modest applications
with signals of interest below 1MHz.

<h2>E-series resistors</h2>
International standard IEC 60063 defines the preferred values for 
resistors and capacitors in a decade.  "In a decade" means values
with the same power of ten when written in scientific notation.
The number of distinct values in any decade if defines the number 
after the "E" with 6,12,24,... being the standard for electronics.
The intervals between values in a decade are separated geometrically,
meaning that to get the next value in the E-6 series you multiply by
a value, not add to that values.  The E-6 series divides a decade into
6 parts, so the multiplicative constant is 10<sup>1/6</sup> because after
multiplying a value x by this constant 6 times you will get 10*x This is
the next decade.  A well equipped lab will have an E-6 series from
10&#8486; up to 10 M&#8486;


Note each value in the E-12 column is a factor of 
10<sup>1/12</sup> times larger than the preceeding value.


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>E-6 value	<td>E-12 value
<tr><td>10	<td>10

When confronted with the task 
of selecting a resistor and capacitors to build a low pass filter
you should choose one of these standard values while keeping the
resistor in the 1k - 1000k interval and a ceramic capacitor in the 
10pF - 1uF decades.  These values will not load the driving circuit,
are available in temperature tolerant packages, and are readily 
available.  Finally, in many applications it is not imparative that
you get the corner frequency exactly correct; close is often good 
enough.
<br><br>

<b>Problem:</b><br>
Design a first order low pass filter with a corner frequency of 
1000 Hz.  Use only E-6 series components.
<br><Br>

<b>Solution:</b><br>
<pre>
f<sub>c</sub> = 1/(2*pi*RC) = 1000Hz
R*C = 1.6*10^-4  = 160*10^-6
</pre>

Now we need to find an RC product close to 160.  From the Test your
understanding problem at the end of the lecture we have several choices
<ul>	<li>10*15 = 150
	<li>22*68 = 1496
	<li>33*47 = 1551
</ul>
I'll choose 33*47 which is as close as we can get to 160?  Remember that
we should be able to get these values in any decade between 10 and 
10,000,000.  So all I need to do is get close any factor of 10 to 160.
So lets choose a 3.3k&#8486; resistor.  Then 

<pre>
R*C = 160*10^-6 with R = 3.3k&#8486; 
yields C = 48nF
</pre>
