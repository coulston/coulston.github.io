<h1>Analog to Digital Conversion</h1>

<h2>Antialias filters</h2>
<ol>

<li>Aliasing:<br>
You're sampling an analog signal at 20kHz.  List all the frequencies in the first four harmonics that will look like 2kHz signals.

<pre>
1st harmonic:	2kHz			20kHz-2kHz = 18kHz
2st harmonic:	20kHz+2kHz=22kHz	40kHz-2kHz = 38kHz
3st harmonic:	40kHz+2kHz=42kHz	60kHz-2kHz = 58kHz
4st harmonic:	60kHz+2kHz=62kHz	80kHz-2kHz = 78kHz
</pre>

<li>Decades:<br>
A first-order LPF has a cutoff frequency of 2kHz.  Describe
the attenuation of an 80kHz input signal in decibels and as
a ratio of output voltage to input voltage.

<pre>
Since a decade is a multiplicative factor of 10, we need to find how may powers of 10 you have to multiply 2 to get 80.  In order words:

2*10<sup>x</sup> = 80, solving for X yields
x = log<sub>10</sub>(80/2) = 1.6

So we know that a 80kHz waveform is 1.6 decades above a 2kHz waveform.  Since the LPF attenuates -20dB/decade, the 80kHz waveform will be attenuated:

1.6*-20 = -32dB

Decibels can be converted to the ratio of output/input using its definition.

-32dB = 20dB log_10(V<sub>out</sub>/V<sub>in</sub>)
V<sub>out</sub>/V<sub>in</sub> = 0.025 = 1/40
</pre>

<li>ADC convert:<br>
You're working with a N-bit ADC and would like to attenuate a full scale
input to a voltage that has a converted value below 1/2 LSB.  How many dB 
will be required to achieve this?

<pre>
The hardware diagram below explains visually what this problem is asking.  The LPF needs to reduce a full scale (5 V) input to a voltage X that has a converted value of 0.5 bits.  We have already looked at this concept when we covered quantization error.

    5 V   X v                   5 V
    --- = ---             X V = ----
    2<sup>N</sup>    0.5                    2<sup>N+1</sup>

This is the input voltage to the ADC which generates 0.5 bit output.  But it is also the output of the LPF when a full scale input (5 V) is applied.  So the LPF needs to attenuate a 5V input into X V.  Let's see how many decibels that works out to.

             (5 V / 2<sup>N+1</sup>)
    20 log<sub>10</sub> -----------   = 20 log<sub>10</sub>(2<sup>-(N+1)</sup>)
                 5 V
