<h2>Assembly conditionals</h2>

The nice thing about conditional statements, structures like if/then,
is that once you learn how to handle one conditional, you can use that
structure as a building block for more complex conditionals.  Take
for example the statement:
<pre>
	if (x8 > y8) then z8=0; else z8=1;
</pre>

The CPFSLT, CPFSEQ and CPFSGT assembly instructions in the PIC are 
ideally suited to help.  The mnemonic stands for "Compare F with W
and skip if &lt;condition&gt;".  Let's see how this works with an 
example in the C code snippet above.<br><br>

The idea is to put the expression to the right of the conditional
statement into the W register and keep the operand to the right
of the conditional in a file register.

<pre>
		MOVF	Y8, W		; move RHS into W
		CPFSGT	X8		; Compare f with W, skip if f > W
		GOTO	ELSE_CLAUSE	; this will be the else clause

THEN_CLAUSE	MOVLW	0x00		; this is what we skipped to
		MOVWF	Z8		; so put 0 into z8
		GOTO	NEXT		; and move beyond the if/then

ELSE_CLAUSE	MOVLW	0x01		; this will be the else clause
		MOVWF	Z8

NEXT		&lt;some stuff&gt;

</pre>

<h2>Loops</h2>
Loops repeat the execution of a collection of statements (called the
body) until some condition is met. Today we will examine two of the
more useful looping structures in Assembly, the for and while loops.

<h3>Count down for-loop</h3>
It may come as a surprise that for-loops that count down would be
the most straightforward to implement in the PIC assembly
language.  Let's look at a side-by-side comparison of two identical
programs.

<table border=1>
<tr><td>C-code</td>	<td>Assembly</td></tr>
<tr> <td>
<pre>
    unit8_t i;
    uint8_t sum = 0;

    for (i=10; i>0; i--) {
	sum += i;
    } // end for
</pre>
</td><td>
<pre>
	CLRF	varS8		; uint8_t sum = 0;
	MOVLW	10
	MOVWF	varI8		; uint8_t i = 10

loop	MOVF	varI8, W	; W <= varI8
	ADDWF	varS8, F	; varS8 <= varS8 + varI8
	DECFSZ	varI8
	GOTO	loop
next	NOP
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

By this point in the semester, the C code should be farily
straightforward.  The loop counter, i, starts at 10 and counts
down each iteration through the for-loop until until it equals
0 when the loop terminates.  The assembly program loads i with
10 and clears the sum.  Each iteration through the loop it adds
i and sum, putting the sum back into the sum variable.    The 
next two instructions in the assembly program are the ones which
perform the work of the for-loop.  The "DECFSZ" instructions
is interpreted to mean "Decrement F skip if zero".  Let's break
this down.
<ul>	<li>"decrement" means subtract one.  The decrement is the
	first operation performed by this instruction,
	<li>"F" is the file register that will have its value
	decremented.  It is the first argument of the assembly 
	instruction.  In the case of our assembly language program,
	file register at address varI8 will have its value decreased
	by 1.  This decrement permanently changes the value of the 
	file register at address varI8,
	<li>"skip if zero" means that when the file register associated
	with this instruction (varI8 in our case), reaches the value
	zero, the instruction immediately following the DECFSZ instruction
	should be skipped.  This means that when varI8 reaches 0 we should
	skip the "GOTO loop" instruction and execute the instruction
	at the label "next".  In this case I placed a NOP instruction
	in this slot as a place-holder for the operation performed after
	the loop terminates.
</ul>

<h3>Count up for-loop</h3>
Count-up loops are similar to their count-down counterparts, but need
more complex checking at the end of the loop.  Let's look at a 
side-by-side comparison to better understand what I mean.

<table border=1>
<tr><td>C-code</td>	<td>Assembly</td></tr>
<tr> <td>
<pre>
    unit8_t i;
    uint8_t sum = 0;

    for (i=3; i<22; i+=6) {
	sum += i;
    } // end for
</pre>
</td><td>
<pre>
	CLRF	varS8		; uint8_t sum = 0;
	MOVLW	3
	MOVWF	varI8		; uint8_t i = 3

loop	MOVF	varI8, W	; W <= varI8
	ADDWF	varS8, F	; varS8 <= varS8 + varI8

	MOVLW	6
	ADDWF	varI8, F	; varI8 <= varI8 + 6;

	MOVLW	22		; W <= 22
	CPFSLT	varI8		; Compare I8 with 22 skip if I8 < 22
	GOTO	next
	GOTO	loop

next	NOP
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

Compared to the count-down loop, this structure takes a lot more
work.  First, we need to explicitly modify the loop variable.  In this
case we need to add 6 to varI8 and store the result back in varI8.
Second we need to carefully consider how to make the loop work correctly.
The loop should contine when I8 < 22, so we will use the "CPFSLT" 
instruction to skip to the "GOTO loop" and contine the loop.  This means
that execute the "GOTO next" instruction when I8 is not less than 22
which is what we want.


<h3>While loop</h3>
Assembly language while loops are very similar to their C-code
counter parts.  Let's examine the following pair of while loops.

<table border=1>
<tr><td>C-code</td>	<td>Assembly</td></tr>
<tr> <td>
<pre>
    uint8_t i = 0;
    uint8_t sum = 0;

    while(i < 10) {
	sum += i;
	i += 1;
    }
</pre>
</td><td>
<pre>
	CLRF	varS8		; uint8_t sum = 0;
	CLRF	varI8		; uint8_t i = 10

loop	MOVLW	10		; move RHS into W
	CPFSLT	varI8		; Compare f with W, skip if f > W
	GOTO	next		; this will be the else clause

	MOVF	varI8, W	; W <= varI8
	ADDWF	varS8, F	; varS8 <= varS8 + varI8
	GOTO	loop
next	NOP
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

The assembly while loop starts with an if/then statement, followed
by the body of the for-loop, and ending with a GOTO to the start
of the while loop. The conditional if/then statements covered at
the beginning of this lecture do the heavy lifting and allow us
to exit out of the loop when the conditional is no longer true.
<br><br>

There is a second form of the while loop that is made to check a 
bit and branch when the bit equals 1 or 0.  For example, let's
say that you are using timer 1 to create a delay.  Furthermore,
let's assume that you have set the initial value of timer 1 (we will
clear the and the TMR1IF flag of the PIR1 register as the first 
instruction in our code snippet).  Now you want to
wait until the TMR1IF flag is set; in C-code this would be equivalent
to: <font face="courier">while (PIR1bits.TMR1IF == 0);</font>
In the PIC assembly language this would look like:

<pre>
	BCF	PIR1, TMR1IF, ACCESS	; clears the TMRIF flag
while0	BTFSS	PIR1, TMR1IF, ACCESS	; while loop
	GOTO	while0
</pre>

The BTFSS stands for bit test F skip if set. Let's break this down so
that we can understand what is going on:
<ul>	<li>"bit test" means that we are going to test for the value
	of a bit inside a file register.  The bit (0-7) is provided
	as the second argument to the instruction.  In this case
	"TMR1IF" is aliased to 0 in the "p18f26k22.inc" file 
	discussed in the previous lecture's "Test your understanding"
	section,
	<li>"F" is the file register that will be testing and is the 
	the first argument of the assembly instruction,
	<li>"skip if set" means that when the bit in the file register 
	associated with this instruction equals 1, the instruction 
	immediately following the BTFSS instruction should be skipped. 
	<li>The "ACCESS" reference means that the PIC will use the 
	ACCESS memory model to locate the PIR1 register.
</ul>

We can now interpret the BTFSS instruction; when the the TMR1IF bit of the 
PIR1 register is equal to 1 (set) then skip the "GOTO loop" instruction and
continue with the instruction following the loop.

<h2>Spaghetti code</h2>
From the eponymously named 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">Wikipedia page</a>
<i>Spaghetti code is a pejorative phrase for source code that has a complex
and tangled control structure, especially one using many GOTO statements&hellip;</i>
The term is derived from the following visual metaphor.  Imagine
while executing your code the computer drew a line between each 
instruction what was executed without ever picking up the drawing 
implement.  Now, focus on just the line draw while mentally removing
the program.  If the lines looks like a random jumble of lines running
everywhere, congratulations you have Spaghetti code.  GOTO statements 
enable many bad coding practices/habits which contribute to Spaghetti 
code. You should interpret the term "pejorative" used in the Wikipedia 
entry to mean that Spaghetti code is a thing to be avoid.  Why?
<ul>	<li>It is harder to maintain (wasted $$)
	<li>It is harder to understand (hides bugs)
	<li>Symptomatic of bad programming practices,
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Write a for loop that starts at 3, counts up by 5 and ends before
reaching 105.

<!--
This should be a pretty straight-forward extension of the example
presented in this lecture.  Note that the NOP is placeholding the
body of the for-loop.

<pre>
	MOVLW	3
	MOVWF	varI8		; uint8_t i = 3

loop	NOP

	MOVLW	5
	ADDWF	varI8, F	; varI8 <= varI8 + 5;

	MOVLW	105		; W <= 105
	CPFSGT	varI8		; Compare I8 with 105 skip if I8 > 105
	GOTO	next
	GOTO	loop

next	NOP
</pre>
-->

<li>Write a for loop that counts up from 1 to 128 (inclusive) by powers
 of 2.

<!--
This is a variation of the example count-up loop presented in this 
lecture but the modification of the loop variable is changed to use 
a shift left.  Note that the NOP is place-holding the body of the 
loop.

<pre>
	MOVLW	1
	MOVWF	varI8		; uint8_t i = 1

loop	NOP

	BCF	STATUS, C	; clear carry bit
	RLCF	varI8, F	; rotate X8 left with carry bit into LSB into W

	MOVLW	128		; W <= 128
	CPFSGT	varI8		; Compare I8 with 128 skip if I8 > 128
	GOTO	next
	GOTO	loop

next	NOP
-->

<li>Write a for loop that counts down from 88 to no less than 42 by 2's.
That is counts down from 88 while the count is greater than or equal to 
42.

<!--
This is a variation of the example count-up loop presented in this 
lecture but the modification of the loop variable is changed to 
decrement by 2.  Note that a DECFSZ will not work for two reasons,
we need to decrement twice and we are not terminating at 0. 
Note that the NOP is place-holding the body of the 
loop.

<pre>
	MOVLW	42
	MOVWF	varT8		; uint8_t temp = 42
	MOVLW	88
	MOVWF	varI8		; uint8_t i = 88

loop	NOP

	MOVLW	2
	SUBWF	varI8

	MOVF	varT8, W	; W <= 42
	CPFSLT	varI8		; Compare I8 with 42 skip if I8 < 42
	GOTO	loop

next	NOP
An important point is illustrated with this example.  The normal logic
order ot the terminating condition is changed because we need to iterate the
loop until varI8 is less than 42.  The logic given will skip the "GOTO loop"
statement only when varI8 is less than 42.

<li>Write a loop that counts up by one while a button is being held down.
Assume that we are working with our active low button on RA2.  
This push button is nominally logic 1 until it's pressed then it has 
the value 0.

<!--
Our loop will look at this bit in LATA2 the GOTO loop while the button
is logic 0.

<pre>
	CLRF	varC8;

loop	INCF	varC8
	BTFSS	LATA, 2, ACCESS
	GOTO	loop
</pre>

<li>Write a loop that counts up by one everytime a button is pressed.
Assume that we are working with our active low button on RA2.  
This push button is nominally logic 1 until it's pressed then it has 
the value 0.<br><br>

<!--
We will wait while the button is not pressed (equal to 1) in the 
while1 loop.  When the button is pressed we will break out of this loop 
and enter a second loop that wait while the button is bring pressed
(equals to 0).  We will then increment the counter and do all this
over again.

	CLRF	varC8;

	GOTO	while1

while0	BTFSS	LATA, 2, ACCESS
	GOTO	while0

	INCF	varC8
	GOTO	loop
