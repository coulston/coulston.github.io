<h1>Assembly Language</h1>
In this final unit of the class, we will examine how to write programs
in <u>assembly language</u>.  An assembly language is the set of
primitive operations that are natively executed by the processor. These
primitive operations are represented in one of two ways, as mnemonics or 
in binary.  The mnemonic form uses letters and numbers to describe the 
primitive operations and their associated operands.  These mnemonics
are called <u>assembly instructions</u> and are suited for humans to 
read.  The binary form uses 0's and 1's to describe the primitive operations
and their associated operands.  These binary forms are called <u>machine 
instructions</u> and are better suited for processors to read.  A program 
written using assembly instructions is called an <u>assembly language 
program</u>.  A program written using machine instructions is called a 
<u>machine language program</u>.
<br><br>

In general, every different processor family has it's own unique assembly 
language.  Consequently, an assembly program written for an Intel processor 
will not run on a Motorola processor.  This contrasts with high-level languages 
(HLLs) like C which are portable across different processors.  A HLLs 
cross-platform portability is a result of two things; the standardization 
of the C programming language and processor-specific compilers. 
<br><br>

In order to understand how to write an assembly language program you
need to understand two concepts, how memory works and the programmers
model of the processors.  For the most part, the representation of data
in memory and the operation of memory is fairly consistent across most 
processors.  For no other reason, let's make this the starting point
in our journey into the relm of assembly langugage.

<h2>Memory</h2>
Understanding a random access memory (RAM) is prerequisite to understanding 
how to program the CPU in assembly language because both our operations and
operands are stored in RAM.

A RAM is a collection of 
contiguous storage locations where data can be stored and retrieved.  The data 
items contained in a RAM, called <u>words</u>, are represented in binary 
and have a fixed width 
called the <u>word size</u>. The data items are moved into and out of a RAM 
using a data bus; the width of this bus is equal to the word size of the 
RAM.  In the case of the HCS12, the word size is 8-bits. 
<br><br>

Every word in a RAM has a unique location, called the word's 
<u>address</u>, different from every other data item in the RAM.  The address
of each word is described as a binary number.  The number of bits in this
binary number of the address size of the RAM.  The HCS12 has 16-bit 
addresses.  If we know that a RAM has N-bits of address the RAM can have
up to 2<sup>N</sup> words in the RAM  because there are 
2<sup>N</sup> difference arrangements of N-bits.
<br><br>

There will be many occasions when you need to store multi-byte 
values in a RAM.  In these cases, the value will be split so that
most significant byte is store at the lowest address.  This is 
called a big-endian representation.  


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Address	<td>Value
<tr><td>0xC040	<td>0x0B
<tr><td>0xC041	<td>0xF5

<ul>	<li>Interpret the 8-bit word at address 0xC040 as an unsigned value.

	<li>Interpret the 16-bit word starting at address 0xC042 as an HCS12
	instruction (hint look at the True-Term simulator image below). 
	Remember that the HCS12 stores things using little endian.
	<li>Interpret the 16-bit word start at address 0xC044 as an address.
	What 8-bit word is stored at this address?
	<li>Interpret the 8-bit words starting at address 0xC046 as a null
	terminates string of ASCII characters. What does it say?
	<li>Add together the 16-bit value starting at address 0xC04C to the
	16-bit word stored at address 0xC04E.

<h3>Demo program</h3>
We will use the following program that looks for the largest element
in an array as the motivating example for our discussion about 
assembly language and the programmers model for the HCS12.  The program's 
lines have been numbers to make the following discussion easier - clearly
the line numbers are not part of the program.

<pre>
00.	// This program looks for the largest element in the array
01.	int8 array[8] = {0x00,0x11,0x22,0x33,0x44,0x55,0x66,0x77};
02.	void main(void) {
03.	    int8 i, max;		// Declare variables
04.	    max=0;			// Initialize max to smallest int8
05.	    for(i=0; i<8; i++) {	// loop through all elements of array
06.		if (array[i] > max) 	// Is array element larger than max?
07.		    max = array[i];	// If so make new max
08.	    }
09.	} // end main
</pre>


This program starts by initializing the variable <b>max</b> to the
smallest possible value so that every element in the array will be 
at least as large as this value.  The for-loop in line 05 enumerates
all eight indicies in the array and compares them against the current
maximum value.  If the current array element is larger than the current
maximum, in line 07, the maximum value is updated to equal this array
value.  At the end of the for-loop, the <b>max</b> contains the largest
element in the array.  The fact that we don't do anything with this 
value is unimportant to our discussion, what is important is how this
C program is represented and executed by the HCS12.
<br><br>

Before we start looking at the hardware that executes a program, we need
to clearly understand how the computer's memory works.  Let's have a small
review to make sure that we are all on the same page.

<h2>Programmers Model</h2>
A programmer's model of a processors described the essential structure
and operation of the processor.  Let's start with a very basic programmer's
model, the computer has a memory which stores instructions and data 
and a central processing unit (CPU) that fetches and executes the 
instructions.  Let's develope the programmers model by answering some
questions about how our C program would be executed by hardware.
<br><br>


<dl>

<dt>Where is the program stored in memory?</dt>
<dd><i>The program can be stored anywhere in memory.  However for practical
reasons it is stored in consecutive locations and separate from data.
</i></dd>

<dt>How is the program represented in memory?</dt>
<dd><i>The answer to this question is complex and the subject of several
upcoming lectures.  However, here is the gist of the thing.  The 
CodeWarrior compiler translates each line of our C program into one or 
more basic, machine dependent, instructions in the machine language.
Since the machine language is stored in memory it consists of 0's and 1's.
In order to facilitate humans working with machine language the binary
machine instructions are frequently reinterpreted using mnemonics into 
assembly language.  There is a one-to-one relationship between an
assembly instruction and a machine instruction meaning given one you
can unambiguously determine the other.  Consequently, being humans, we 
will most frequently work with assembly instructions.
</i></dd>

<dt>How does CPU know where program is stored in memory?</dt>
<dd><i>Since we insisted that the instruction were stored in consecutive 
memory locations, the CPU only need to know the location of the first
instruction.  It stores this address in a register called the program
counter (PC).
</i></dd>

<dt>How does CPU execute the program?</dt>
<dd><i>The CPU goes through an endless sequence of 
<ul>	<li>Fetch the instruction at the PC,
	<li>Decode the instruction,
	<li>Execute the instruction,
	<li>Increment the PC,
	<li>Check for interrupts,
</ul>
</i></dd>

<dt>What does the CPU do when power is applied?</dt>
<dd> <i>When the CPU power's up, the PC is loaded with the address stored
at memory location 0xFFFF.   
</i></dd>


<dt>Where is array stored in memory?</dt>
<dd><i>The array can be stored anywhere in memory.  However for practical
reasons it is stored in consecutive locations and separate from the 
instructions.
</i></dd>

<dt>How is array represented in memory?</dt>
<dd><i>As we discussed previously, everything in a memory is represented in
binary.  Fortunately, the array values have an obvious 8-bit binary
representation.  For example, 0x33 is represented as 00110011 in memory.
The next memory location would be the next array element and contain 01000100.
</i></dd>

<dt>How does CPU know where data is stored in memory?</dt>
<dd><i>As we discussed previously, everything in a memory has a location
given by its address.  So the CPU must know the address of the array elements.
The CPU will store the address of the array in 16-bit index registers X and Y.
</i></dd>


<dt>How is data manipulated by the program?</dt>
<dd><i>In order to perform data manipulations like addition, the CPU will
use accumulators inside the CPU.  General-purpose 8-bit accumulators A and B are used to hold operands and results of operations.  Some instructions treat the combination of these two 8-bit accumulators (A : B) as a 16-bit double accumulator (D).  Most operations can use accumulator A or B interchangeably. However, there are a few exceptions. Add, subtract, and compare instructions involving both A and B (ABA, SBA, and CBA) only operate in one direction, so it is important to make certain the correct operand is in the correct accumulator. The decimal adjust accumulator A (DAA) instruction is used after binary-coded decimal (BCD) arithmetic operations.  There is no equivalent instruction to adjust accumulator B.
</i></dd>


<dt>How does the CPU manipulate things like the port T data direction
register?</dt>
<dd>
<i>The HCS12 uses a memory-mapped approach to storing the special function
register between address 0x0000 to 0x03FF.  In the specific case of the
Port T Data Direction Register, I opened the mc9s12c32.h file inside the
CodeWarrior development environment, searched for "DDRT", and came across
the following comment as the first result.
<pre>
/*** DDRT - Port T Data Direction Register; 0x00000242 ***/
</pre>
This strongly suggests that the DDRT register is accessed by reading
and writing memory location 0x0242.
</i></dd>
</dl>

The image below will be the subject for the remainder of the lecture
and shows the C-code, assembly code, CPU core registers, and the 
HCS12 memory where the program is stored.

<ul>
<li>Use two separate resources to determine the addresses for the following
device registers.  To do this you will need to consult:
<ul>	<li>The detailed Register Map (section 1.2.2) in the MC9S12C hardware 
	manual posted on the class web page,
	<li>The mc9s12c32.h file inside the CodeWarrior development 
	environment.
</ul>
For each register provide two pieces of information from each source,
the page or line number where you found the information and the value
of that device's address.  Clearly, both addresses should agree.
