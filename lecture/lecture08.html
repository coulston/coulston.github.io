<h1>GPIO</h1>
In order to master control of the GPIO pins you will need three concepts,
delay, manipulation of input and manipulation of output.

<h2>A common input device - buttons and switches</h2>
Before jumping into code to check buttons and switches, let's take
a moment to examine the language (nomenclature) used to describe 
switches and buttons.


<h3>Switch nomenclature</h3>
<ul>	<li><b>Poles:</b> The number of separate circuits 
		controlled by a switch.
	<li><b>Throw:</b> The number of discrete positions
		the switch can be put into.
	<li><b>N.O.</b> Normally Open.  When the switch is
		not being actively manipulated the terminals of
		the switch are not touching, meaning that the switch
		terminals are in an open circuit configuration.
	<li><b>N.C.</b> Normally Closed.  When the switch is
		not being actively manipulated the switch terminals
		are in contact with one another meaning the switch 
		terminals are in a short circuit configuration.
</ul>

Several switch configurations are shown in the figure below.  Each
of these configurations has its abreviatied name given in the form
#P#T, where #P is the number of poles (single/1 or double/2) and #T
is the number of throws (single/1, double/2, or 3).

<br><img src="./img/switches.bmp"><br><br>

The arrow in the figures above is a conductor that can be moved 
between the throws (circles on the right).  In the case of a single 
throw switch ("ST" or those with only one circle on the right) the 
conductor either makes contact with the opposing conductor or is in an
open circuit configuration.  The default configuration of a single
throw switch is referred to as either normally open (N.O.) or. normally 
closed (N.C.).  The distinction between these two types of switches is 
the state of the connection between the two terminals of the switch when 
the button is not depressed.  The terminal in a N.O. switch are not 
connected (open) when the button is not pressed.  Hence they are normally 
open.  Similiarilty the terminals of a N.C. switch are connected until 
the button is pressed. 
The dotted line in the figure represents the actuating mechanism
that moves all the poles simultanously and in a cordinated fashion.
<br><br>

There are two ways that you can connect buttons to your circuit,
active high and active low as shown in the circuit diagram below. The
switches are shown in the open position which indicates that they 
are N.O.  
<br><img src="./img/button.jpg"><br><br>

The configuration determines what logic level is output when the 
button is pressed according to the following table.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Active low</td>
    <td>When the button is pressed, pin RA0 is attached to ground.  This
	will cause Port A bit 0 to read a logic 0.
        When the button is not pressed, pin RA0 is weakly pulled-up to 3.3V
	through the resistor. This will cause Port A bit 0 to read a logic 1.
	When the button is pressed (active) the Port pin will read a logic
	0 (low).  Note, the resistor is necessary to prevent a short-circuit
	between 3.3V and GND when the button is pressed.  A value of 10k&ohm;
	is typical.</td>
<tr><td>Active high</td>
    <td>When the button is pressed, pin RA1 is attached to 3.3.  This
	will cause Port A bit 1 to read a logic 1.
        When the button is not pressed, pin RA1 is weakly pulled-down to 0V
	through the resistor. This will cause Port A bit 1 to read a logic 0.
	When the button is pressed (active) the Port pin will read a logic
	1 (high). </td></tr>
</table>

Note, when reading a value from a GPIO pin you need to reference the 
pins associated PORT register.  So for example, to read the value 
on the active low pin you would reference "PORTAbits.RA0".

<h3>Digging deeper</h3>
In order to completly understand the operation of a switch and their 
associated resistors, you need to dig a little deeper and understand
that is going on inside the chip.  The following figure shows an
active low switch connected to an I/O pin of the PIC.  The pull-up
resistor has a pretty typical value of 1k&ohm;  Most chips these
days have inputs that are connected to the gate a MOSFET.  This
MOSFET gate can be modeled as a pair of resistors (with very high
resistances), one attached to 
3.3V and the other to ground as shown.  The analog voltage seen
between these resistors is converted into a digital voltage by a 
"chip voltage detection circuit".

<br><img src="./img/chipIO.bmp"><br><br>

Now, let's ask ourselves what voltage the "chip voltage detection 
circuit" sees when the button is in its normally open configuration
as shown.   In this case, the 1k&ohm; and 1G&ohm; resistors tied
to 3.3V are in parallel.  You can use the parallel resistor equation
to calculate the equivlent resistance as follows:

<pre>
		    1
	R_eq = -----------
		 1	 1
		---  + 	---
		1k&ohm;     1G&ohm;
</pre>

which is very close to 1k&ohm; because 1G&ohm; is so much larger than 
1k&ohm;.  Hence we will call the parallel combination 1k&ohm; Combining 
these two
parallel resistors simplifies the circuit to a series circuit with
a 1k&ohm; resistor (connected to 3.3V) connected to a 1G&ohm; resistor
connected to ground.  The voltage at the "chip voltage detection circuit"
is:
<pre>
		  1G&ohm;
	3.3V * 	---------
		1k&ohm; + 1G&ohm; 
</pre>

Which is esentially 3.3V.  So, when the button is in a normally open
configuration, the chip senses 3.3V and registers a logic 1.  On the 
other hand, when the 
button is in its closed position, the GPIO pin is attached to ground
causing the "chip voltage detection circuit" to reach 0v, registering
logic 0.


<h2>Wait for button press</h2>
In order to synchronize the actions of the microcontroller to a human,
we will frequently program the microcontroller to wait for a button
press.<br>
In the following example you should assume that the push button
is normally open and wired active high. The port pin associated
with the button has been aliased, via
<font face="courier">#define BUTTON PORTAbits.RA0</font> to BUTTON.
Thus when the push button is pressed, BUTTON will equal logic 1 and 
when the push button is not pressed, BUTTON will read a logic 0.<br>
Second, we will connect an LED to an output pin on the microcontroller in
a active high configuration.  The port pin associated with the LED
has been aliased, via <font face="courier">#define LED LATAbits.LATA1</font> 
to LED.  Assigning LED to 0 will turn the LED off, 
assigning a 1 will turn the LED on.<br>
Finally, we need to recognize that <u>the microcontroller is executing the
instructions many millions of times faster than a user can press or 
release the button.</u>  With these assumptions in place lets look at a
practical delay loop that you will see many times in our course.
<br><br>

<pre>
1.    LED = 0;			// turn off the LED
2.    for(;;) {
3.    	while(BUTTON == 0);	// wait for a button press
4.    	while(BUTTON == 1);	// wait for a button release
5.	LED ^= 1;		// toggle the LED
6.    }
</pre><br><br>

Let's walk through the program from top to bottom.  To facilitate this
discussion, I have added line numbers in the far left; please understand
that these are not actually part of the program.<br>

<b>Line 1</b> turns the LED off.  While not strictly part of the problem 
statement, its often a good idea to put indicators like Leeds into a 
know initial state at the start of a program.<br>

<b>Lines 2-6</b> form an infinite loop.  Meaning that our computer will forever
be checking the state of the button and turning the LED on and off.<br>

<b>Line 3</b> is a while-loop that executes its (empty) body while the button
is not pressed.  There are two important points to make here.  First,
<u>the microcontoller may get stuck executing this while-loop many millions
of times before the button is pressed.</u>   This is because the PIC
is running at 64MHz, meaning that its executing 64 million (assembly)
instructions per second.  Hence, it can do a lot of checks every second.
Second, while our program is executing this while-loop <u>it is doing
absolutely nothing except checking that button.</u>  This is the 
quintessential delay loop, synchronizing the execution of our program 
to the user's input by waiting and doing nothing until the user performs
some task.  You rarely see these types of statements in other programming
classes because variables in those classes only change under your programs
control, but in this class we will have variables that change based on
actions performed outside your program.<br>

<b>Line 4</b> is a while-loop that executes its (empty) body while the button
is pressed. Once again, the PIC is executing statements millions of times
faster than the user can release the button.  Hence, our program needs to
wait until the button has been released before continuing.<br>

<b>Line 5</b> toggle the state of the LED after the button has been pressed
and then released.
<br><br>


<h2>A common output device - LEDs</h2>
LEDs are polarized devices that, when current is passed through them,
produce light.  Polarized, means that the terminals of the device
are not interchangable.  In order to produce light, current must pass
from the anode to the cathode.   When looking at a LED there are several
ways to distinguish between the anode and cathode as shown in the following
image from <a href="http://henrysbench.capnfatz.com/">Henry's Bench</a>.

<br><img src="./img/ledDiagram.jpg"><br><br>

Note, if you try to pass current from the cathode to the anode, 
no current will flow and the LED will not produce light.  
There are two ways that you can connect LEDs to your circuit,
active high and active low shown in the circuit diagram below.
Note that both RA0 and RA1 are configured as outputs with the
following instructions.
<pre> 
    TRISAbits.TRISA0 = 0;	// clearing TRIS bit makes RA0 an output
    TRISAbits.TRISA1 = 0;	// clearing TRIS bit makes RA1 an output
</pre>


<br><img src="./img/led.jpg"><br><br>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Active high</td> 
    <td>When you set Port A bit 1 to logic 1, the pin RA1 goes to 3.3V.
	This forward-bias the voltage across the diode (LED) causing current
	to flow through the LED and illuminating it.<br>
        When you clear Port A bit 1 to logic 0, the pin RA1 goes to 0V.
	This creates no voltage drop across the diode (LED).  Thus no current
	flows through the LED and it does not illuminate.<br>
	Thus, the LED illuminates (is active) when the Port bit is logic 1
	(high).  </td></tr>
<tr><td>Active low</td> 
    <td>When you clear Port A bit 0 to logic 0, the pin RA0 goes to 0V.
	This forward-bias the voltage across the diode (LED) causing current
	to flow through the LED and illuminating it.<br>
        When you set Port A bit 1 to logic 1, the pin RA1 goes to 3.3V.
	This creates no voltage drop across the diode (LED).  Thus no current
	flows through the LED and it does not illuminate.<br>
	Thus, the LED illuminates (is active) when the Port bit is logic 0
	(low).  </td></tr>
</table>

In order to turn the LEDs on or off you need to write the output latch
associated with the pin.  The nomenclature for the latch associated with
GPIO pin Rx# is "LATxbits.LATx#"  Setting a latch bit will cause the 
associated GPIO pin to go to 3.3V, clearing a latch bit will cause the
associated GPIO pin to go to 0V.  Let's see if you can put all this together
to answer the questions below.

<pre>
	LATAbits.LATA0 = 0;	// What does this command do?
	LATAbits.LATA0 = 1;	// What does this command do?
	LATAbits.LATA1 = 0;	// What does this command do?
	LATAbits.LATA1 = 1;	// What does this command do?
</pre>

<!--
<pre>
	LATAbits.LATA0 = 0;	// Turns active low LED on
	LATAbits.LATA0 = 1;	// Turns active low LED off
	LATAbits.LATA1 = 0;	// Turns actice high LED off
	LATAbits.LATA1 = 1;	// WTurns actice high LED on
</pre>
-->

The resistor in the circuit diagrams is called a <u>current-limiting</u>
resistor and its job is to limit the amount of current flowing through
the LED.  You can calculate a value for this resistor by consulting the
datasheet for the LED and looking up Vf and Imax.  Vf is the forward
voltage drop you should expect across the LED when it's illuminated.
Imax is the maximum continous current.  For a red LED, typicall values
would be Vf = 2V and Imax = 20mA.  To be conservative, I run LEDs at
about 30% of their maximum current.   Try calulating the resistance 
value that would produce this much current through the resistor.

<!---
V_resistor = 3.3V - 2V = 1.3V
I_resistor = 0.3 * 20mA = 6mA
R_resistor = V_resistor/I_resistor = 1.3V/6mA = 217 Ohms

<h2>Delay routine</h2>
An inherent problem exists in all our interactions with micontrollers, they
operate on time scales of microseconds, while we operate on a time scale of
seconds.  In order to breach this difference we need to slow down the
microcontroller or speed-up our preception.  In order to accomplish the
second, we need to resort to artificial aides like oscilloscopes. The
first is accomplished by having the microcontroller delay for periods
of time.  In the following section you can assume to have a
function called "delay" which takes as an argument an uint8_t and produces
a delay of consisting of that many "delay units".  Its function prototype
looks like:
<font face="courier">void delay(uint8_t delayUnits);</font>
While the exact duration of a delay unit is unimportant in our exercise, 
the fact that <u>the microcontroller does nothing during the execution of 
the delay function</u> is.  We are intentionally telling the microcontroller
to do nothing, and this can prove to be very useful when we have precise
control over how long the microcontroller does nothing.  To see how, let's
proceed with the following examples.

<h3>Generating output patterns</h3>
In order to program a microcontroller to control and communicate with
the outside world, you will need to be able to program precise 
sequences of logic activity on GPIO pins.  In the following exercises,
the expression "LED" has been aliased via a 
<font face="courier">#define </font> statement to a GPIO pin and that
pin has been configured as an output.  The LED attached to the GPIO
pin is wired so that it functions active high.

<li>
Let's apply these concepts by configureing our PIC with the active high
LED connected to RA1 and the active low push button connected to RA0.
Let's write a program that illuminates the LED when the button is pressed.
Remember that when working with input pins that are functionally multiplex 
with analog to digital converter channels <u>you must configure inputs to be 
digital by clearing the associated analog select bit</u>.  We do not need
to configure the analog select bit when a pin is configured to be an output.

    while(1) {
