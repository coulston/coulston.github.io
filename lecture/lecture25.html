<h1>Using an I2C device</h1>
This next week's lab will require you to store microphone samples into
an electrically eraseable read only memory (EEPROM).  The general flow
of data from the microphone into the EEPROM is shown in the image below.

<br><img src="../lab/lab09/img/system.bmp"><br><br>

As shown in this figure, the EEPROM is connected to the PIC through a
pair of signals over an I2C bus.  In order to complete this lab you will
need to understand the EEPROM and the I2C bus.  We will start with the
EEPROM.


<h2>24LC256 EEPROM</h2>
The 24LC256 is a serial EEPROM manufacture by Microchips.  It is a
a non-volatile memory that can store 256k bits, or 32k bytes.  The
"256" in "24LC256" is a reference to the number of of k bits.  The term 
"non-volatile" is synonymous with EEPROM and means that the memory does not 
loose its contents when you remove power from the chip.  The term "serial"
means that communication with the EEPROM occurs 1 bit at a time.  In our
case, the serial communication takes place over a I2C bus.

The 24LC256 EEPROM is physically organized into groups of 64 bytes,
each called a page.  Each byte of data in the EEPROM has a distinct address, 
starting at 0x0000 up to 0x8000.  You are able to read and write up to 64 bytes
at a time.   Page address are multiples of 64<sub>10</sub> or 0x40.
A write operation moves new data into the EEPROM, overwriting
whatever data was there before.  A read operation is a non-destructive
copy of data out of the EEPROM - the existing data in the EEPROM is
not changed. 
<br><br>

You can read and write data in units as small as a single byte and as
large as a page.  In order to complete a read or write operation the
EEPROM maintains an address register.  Every read or write operation
automatically increments the address register.  If needed, you can 
overwrite the value in the address register.
<br><br>


<h2>Write operations</h2>
Writing data to the EEPROM is a two step operation.  First the data
you are writing is put into a volatile memory.  Next, the data in
the volatile memory is transferred into the non-volatile storage.
In order to understand how your firmware will accomplish this, you
will need to be familiar with the following image which shows 
what information the 24LC256 EEPROM expects when the PIC writes
a page of data.
<br><img src="./img/24lc256packet.bmp"><br><br>

Let's work through Figure 6-2 from beginning (left) to end (right) of
a page write operation.
<ul>	<li>The PIC first must establish a connection
	with the EEPROM by transmitting the 7-bit address of the EEPROM.
	As shown in Figure 6-2, the device address of the EEPROM is
	0b1010000 (you will see in the lab that A2, A1, A0 are 0,0,0).
	<li>After the EEPROM sees its device address it asserts an 
	acknowledge (ACK) bit, which tells the PIC that the EEPROM is 
	able to receive a write operation.
	<li>Next the PIC transmit the 15-bit starting address that 
	the PIC wants to start writing to.
	<li>Next the PIC sends up to 64 bytes of data to store in the
	EEPROM.  The EEPROM stores these bytes into its volatile 
	memory.
	<li>The PIC asserts a STOP condition to tell the EEPROM to
	commit the contents of its volatile memory to its non-volatile
	memory at the 15-bit address.
	<li>While the EEPROM is writing to its non-volatile memory,
	the EEPROM will not acknowledge attempts by the PIC to write.
</ul>


The Microchips Code Configurator provides the I2C2_MasterWrite function
providing a simple interface to this complex process.

<pre>
I2C2_MasterWrite(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, EEPROM_I2C_ADDR, &I2C_Wflag);
</pre>

The I2C2 function uses interrupts to transfer BUFFER_SIZE bytes from
buffer to the volatile buffer inside the EEPROM.  Once this 
transfer is complete, you can poll the I2C_Wflag to determine when the
EEPROM has completed the write to its non-volatile memory. 
<br><br>


The arguments are as follows:
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>parameter declaration	<td>Purpose
<tr><td>uint8_t buffer[]	<td>Hold the data to be sent to the 
	I2C device with the first piece of data sent being at array
	index 0 and the last piece of data sent being at the last array
	index. With reference to Figure 6-2 above, the buffer[0] would
	hold "Address High Byte" and buffer[65] would hold "Data Byte 63".
	Note that the buffer array would need to hold 66 bytes (64 data
	bytes plus 2 address bytes), hence the array ends with index 65.
<tr><td>BUFFER_SIZE  <td>This parameter tells the function
	how many bytes from the buffer to send across the I2C bus. 
	For a complete page this would be 66 bytes, 2 butes for the 
	Address High/Low Bytes and 64 bytes for the data.
<tr><td>#define EEPROM_I2C_ADDR	<td>This is the 7-bit address of the
	I2C device that you are trying to communicate with.  Since 
	you are calling the "I2C2_MasterWrite" function the 
	R/<font style="text-decoration: overline;">W</font> bit is set
	to 0.  This function takes care of sending the "Control Byte"
	shown in Figure 6-2, hence the control byte <u>should not</u> be 
	included in the buffer.
<tr><td>I2C2_MESSAGE_STATUS     I2C_Wflag;
	<td>The "&" symbol in the parameter "&I2C_Wflag" means that the
	write function gets a pointer variable to I2C_Wflag.  This gives
	the write function the ability to updates the I2C_Wflag variable
	<u>after</u> the function call has exited.  Remember that the bulk
	of the work performed by the write function is done in the
	interrupt service routine which takes many milliseconds to 
	complete.   This feature provides your code with the status of 
	the data write.
	<br><br>
  	The data type "I2C2_MESSAGE_STATUS" is an enumerated type, meaning
	that it can take on a value in the left-most column below.
	Each of these values tells you about the state of the data 
	transmission.  I've only presented the three states of the 
	I2C2_MESSAGE_STATUS that you will encounter in your lab.

	<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
	<tr><td>flag value	<td>Meaning</td></tr>
    	<tr><td>I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING,	
	<td> If you are using the I2C_Wflag variable, you should initialize
	it to I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING. As long as the flag equals this value,
	the write function has not encountered any complications or has not
	completed transmitting the contents of the buffer.

	<tr><td>I2C2_MESSAGE_COMPLETE	
	<td>This means that the I2C2_MasterWrite function has transferred
	the buffer into the EEPROM's non-volatile memory.  At this point,
	the EEPROM will being the long process of committing this 
	data into its non-volatile memory.

    	<tr><td>I2C2_DATA_NO_ACK	
	<td>When the control byte is sent, a slave with the stated
	DEVICE_ADDRESS should pull the SDA line low during the ACK
	time slice (after the 8th bit).  If the SDA line is not pulled
	low, the flag status will change to "I2C2_DATA_NO_ACK".  You can
	interpret this as the device is not on the bus or the slave device
	is s not finished performing some previous operation.
	</table>
</table>

In order to make the I2C2_MasterWrite function work in an environment
where you are trying to store multiple pages, you need to introduce
some wait loops to allow the EEPROM to commit pages into its non-viola tile
memory.  This is done in the following example of a page write to the
EEPROM.

<pre>
#define EEPROM_I2C_ADDR     0b1010000       // 7-bit address for 24LC256
#define BLOCK_SIZE          64              // 0x40

void main() {

    I2C2_MESSAGE_STATUS      I2C_Wflag;
    uint8_t                  pData[BLOCK_SIZE+2];

    pData[0] = pageAddress>>8;
    pData[1] =  (uint8_t) pageAddress;

    I2C_Wflag = I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING;                    
    I2C2_MasterWrite(pData, BLOCK_SIZE+2, EEPROM_I2C_ADDR, &I2C_Wflag);
    while(I2C_Wflag == I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING); 

    do {
	I2C_Wflag = I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING;
	I2C2_MasterWrite(pData, 0, EEPROM_I2C_ADDR, &I2C_Wflag); 
	while(I2C_Wflag == I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING);
    } while(I2C_Wflag == I2C2_DATA_NO_ACK);
} // end main
</pre>

There are three time intervals that you will measure in the associated
lab.  These are:
<ul>	<li>The time required to call the I2C2_MasterWrite function,
	<li>The time required to transfer pData over the I2C bus,
	<li>The time required for the 24LC256 to commit the data
	to its non-volatile memory.
</ul>

You set and clear pins in your program and use an oscilloscope to 
look at the pulses on the associated pin to measure the times required
for these three operations.

<h3>Read operation</h3>
Compared to writing data, reading data is less complex and requires
less time.  This is because there is no overhead associated with
writing to the non-volatile memory.  The process of reading 
is summarized by the I2C bus activity presented in Figure 8-2 and 8-3
of the 24LC256 technical documents and reproduced below.

<br><img src="./img/24lc256Readpacket.bmp"><br><Br>

Let's walk through this sequence to understand it better.
A PIC will read one page from an address in the EEPROM as follows:
<ul>
	<li>The PIC first must establish a connection with the EEPROM
	 by transmitting the 7-bit address of the EEPROM. As shown in 
	Figure 8-2, the device address of the EEPROM is 0b1010000 (you 
	will see in the lab that A2, A1, A0 are 0,0,0).
	<li>After the EEPROM sees its device address it asserts an 
	acknowledge (ACK) bit, which tells the PIC that the EEPROM is 
	able to receive a write operation.
	<li>Next the PIC transmit the 15-bit starting address that the 
	PIC wants to start "writing" to.  The PIC will send no data to
	write.  The only effect of this "write" is to initialize the
	EEPROMs address register with the starting address of the read
	that is coming.
	<li>The PIC issues a restart condition to the EEPROM with a 
	request to read.
	<li>The EEPROM sends the data bytes,
	<li>The PIC asserts an acknowledge (ACK) at the end of every
	data packet except for the last byte where the PIC sends a
	not-acknowledge (NACK).
	<li>The EEPROM understands the NACK and stops sending data.
</ul>


A read operation usually requires two separate steps.  The first is a
"fake-write" of 0-bytes.  I call this a fake-write, because you are
not writing any data to the memory.  Instead, this write operation 
is used to set the address register inside the EEPROM to
to the address you want to read
data from.  Note, the EEPROM will not try to commit a 0-byte write 
operation so you will not have to wait for the commit.  After
the fake-write, you can request a genuine read of 64-bytes.  The 
transfer of this data over the I2C bus will require a significant 
amount of time.  Your program can poll the status of this read operation,
or just wait a sufficient amount of time for the read to complete.
<br><Br>

On a read operation, the EEPROM will auto increment the address pointer
after every byte read, even across page boundaries.  Hence, if you
wanted to read the entire contents of the EEPROM, you could perform
a fake-write to address 0, then issue consecutive page reads, each
one coming from an incrementally larger page of the EEPROM.
<br><Br>

The following code snippet shows how to perform a single page read from
the EEPROM.

<pre>
#define EEPROM_I2C_ADDR     0b1010000       // 7-bit address for 24LC256
#define BLOCK_SIZE          64              // 0x40

void main() {

    I2C2_MESSAGE_STATUS      I2C_Wflag;
    uint8_t                  pData[BLOCK_SIZE+2];

    pData[0] = pageAddress>>8;
    pData[1] =  (uint8_t) pageAddress;
    I2C_Wflag = I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING;
    I2C2_MasterWrite(pData, 2, EEPROM_I2C_ADDR, &I2C_Wflag);
    while(I2C_Wflag == I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING);                       
                
    I2C_Wflag = I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING;
    I2C2_MasterRead(pData, BLOCK_SIZE, EEPROM_I2C_ADDR, &I2C_Wflag);
    while(I2C_Wflag == I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING);
}
</pre>
