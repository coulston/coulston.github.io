<h3>InLab5</h3>
Look over the <a href="./lcd.html">lcd tutorial</a> document and
answer the following questions.

<ol>
<li>Make a table with 14 columns and 2 rows.  In the top row write the
numbers from 14 downto 1.  In the second row write the name of the 
corrsponding pin of the LCD.  For example pin 12 is DB5.
<li>Configure the LCD in 8-bit mode, with 2 rows using 5x8 characters,
with no cursor, autoincrement the adddress.  For each of the 
instructions determine the hexadecimal code and execution time.  You 
can get this information on pages 12-16 of the Samsung technical documents.
<ul>	<li>Function set
        <li>Display control
        <li>Entry mode set
        <li>Clear display
        <li>Return home         </ul>
<li>Use the timing diagram on page 34 of the samsung technical document
and describe in a complete English sentence or two what tsu1 and tsu2
mean.
<li>What symbol is used to decribe the minimum amount of time that
E has to be strobed?  Make sure to include units.
<li>What is the minimum amount of time that you have to wait between
asserting E high and reading from the LCD?  Make sure to include units.
What symbol is used to describe this value?
<li>Do you read data from the LCD while E is high, or do you 
return E low before reading?
</ol>

Now we will perform some experiments with BehrendBug.  Create
a lab5 project built around <a href="lab5.c">lab5.c</a>
<ol start=7>
<li>What address does the T0CON reside at?
<li>What address does the TMR0 reside at?
<li>Completely describe how TMR0 is setup in words.
<li>What BehrendBug command will allow a user to view data memory?
<li>What is the value of TMR0 in data memory?
<li>What happens to TMR0 when you resume lab5.c and then break back
into behrendBug?
<li>What is the value of T0CON when in BehrendBug?
<li>Examine the configuration bits (see page 195 in 18f452
data sheet) in program memory.  What are the meaning and values of 
the configuration bit CONFIG1?
</ol>


<h3>Hardware</h3>
Solder a 14-pin header to your LCD.  Make sure to attach it to
pins 1-14.  Do not bother connecting the backlight pins 15 and 16,
our LCDs do not have backlights.  After you have pins attached to the
LCD, wire up your LCD to your PIC as follows.
<ul>	<li>Connect the data lines of the LCD to PORTD
	<li>Connect RS to PORTC.3
	<li>Connect R/W' to PORTC.4
	<li>Connect E to PORTC.5
</ul>

<h3>Software:</h3>
The data line will have to be bidirectional because you will poll the
BUSY flag after write operations to determine when the LCD has 
completed its operation.  Your LCD system should have the following
functions.

<ul>
<li><b>void INIT_PIC();</b>
This function sets up the PIC for operation.

<li><b>void INIT_LCD();</b>
This function configures the LCD.  I found that the following 
power-up sequence to work with our LCDs.
<ol>	<li>wait 2mS for power-up
	<li>Function set
	<li>Display control
	<li>Entry mode set
	<li>Clear display
	<li>Return home		</ol>


<li><b>void LCD_WRITE(int8 reg_sel, int8 data);</b>
This function will write the given data to the LCD using the
RS mode given.  You can either have the MCU enter a fixed 37uS
delay (using delay_us function) or for a bonus you can have 
the MCU poll the BUSY flag (using LCD_READ) and wait for
it to go to FALSE.


<li><b>int8 LCD_READ(int8 reg_sel);</b> This function will return 
	a 8-bit value for the register select.  Make sure to follow
	the following sequence
	<ol>	<li>Configure PORTD as an input
		<li>Assert correct values for RS, R/W', E
		<li>wait 1uS for data to stabilize
		<li>Read PORTD
		<li>Assert correct values for RS, R/W', E
		<li>Configure PORTD as an output
	</ol>

</ul>
In addition your program should have a complete set of #define's 
for the LCD instructions.  These should be included in your lab5.h
file.
	<ul>	<li>CLEAR_DISPLAY
		<li>SHIFT_DISPLAY_RIGHT
		<li>SHIFT_DISPLAY_LEFT
		<li>SET_DDRAM_ADDR - you will have to mask in the position
		using the "|" operator.		</ul>

You have a choice of writing one of 3 different programs this week.  Since
they build off one another, I might suggest starting with a stripped down
version of the easiest and working towards the more complicated programs.

<ol>
<li><b>Interactive LCD (max grade C)</b>
You are to write a program that will allow you to interactively work 
with the LCD. The main menu should contain the following options.

<pre>
    1: Write to current location (until carriage return)
    2: Scroll the display
    3: Reset display 
</pre>

<b>Option 1</b> should allow the user to type a character and see 
it on the display if the DDRAM is pointed inside the window. The 
DDRAM should be configured to autoincrement after a write so that 
the cursor is automatically positioned at the next available 
character. Echo the characters back to the terminal so that the 
user can verify what they typed. Remember that the LCD displays 
ASCII just like the terminal. The user is to remain in this mode 
(continuously printing characters) until carriage return (hex 0x0D) 
is pressed, at which time you are to print the main menu.
<br><br>

<b>Option 2</b> should allow the user to set up a rotation of the 
entire display until a key.  Pause the display between consecutive 
shifts (around 0.2 seconds or so).
<br><br>

<b>Option 3</b> should allow the user to clear the entire display, 
move the cursor to the home position and move the window back to 
its nominal position.
<br><br>

<li><b>Clock (max grade B)</b>
Use TMR0 to set up an interrupt which sets a global variable, NEW_SEC,
TRUE once every second. Main will wait for NEW_SEC to go TRUE, and then
increment the time, display it on the LCD, and then wait for the next
NEW_SEC.  Time should be displayed using the following format:
<pre>
	hh:mm:ss
</pre>
Where hh is the hours in military time (0-23), mm is the minutes (0-59),
and ss is the seconds (0-59).  It would be reasonable to keep separate
variables for each of the 6 characters involved in the time display.
This would make converting the time into ASCII much easier.

<li><b>Asteroids (max grade A)</b>
A much better project would be to create a simple asteroids game 
which would consist of driving your
space ship (The letter "<" or a cool Japanese character) though a
field of astroids (the letter "*" or a cool Japanese character)
hurtling at you.  You could move your space ship either in the
top or bottom row, with your ship always in the rightmost column
of the display.  Actually, the astroids are going nowhere, you are
just shifting the LCD frame over a fixed field of astricks while
erasing and redrawing your spaceship.  You should use a simple LFSR
to determine the placement of the astroids.  See 
<a href="http://psbweb2.psu-erie.bd.psu.edu/cenbd452/lectures/lecture12.html">
lecture 12</a> from CENBD452 for more details about LFSRs.  You 
could even play some simple sounds over your speaker!
