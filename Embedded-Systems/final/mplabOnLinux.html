<h1>Basic Idea</h1>
This script is a replacement for the device programming functionality 
of MPLABX using the command line in Linux. From the author...
<br><br>


I did some research online and found out that MPLAB ships with a tool
to interface with the PICkit and other Microchip programmers, so I wrote
a bash script that emulates the programming functionality of MPLAB given
a .hex file (as well as a short function that lets me make and program
my PIC from within Emacs). I figured I would let you know just in case
any other students have asked you about this - I'd be happy to share
my code with anybody that wants it.
<br><br>

A post script....
As a followup, Microchip's IPECMD tool tends to spew log files in the
run directory, which can get annoying. I suppose this is useful, but
all of the useful output is already echoed to stdout.  It also requires 
an MPLABX installation (there doesn't seem to be a standalone IPECMD 
download). I failed to mention this in my comments.

## Before running, you must compile your code to a .hex file. MPLAB generates a
## Makefile for each project, so you simply need to run 'make' in the project
## directory.
##
## The .hex file will be located at
## [project dir]/dist/default/production/dev.production.hex

# Currently, the device (PIC18F26K22) and programmer (PICkit 3) are hardcoded
# If you put this in your PATH, you can use a relative path for the .hex file
# For more information, see the documentation in
# [mplab install directory]/docs
