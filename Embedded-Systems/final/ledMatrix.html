<h2>Binary LED display</h2>
The following image is of an 8x8 LED array.
<br><center><img src="./img/array.bmp"></center><br><br>

The technical documentation for these LEDs states that
they can handle 10mA continous current and up to 80mA  at a 10%
duty cycle.  You are to use the PIC18F452 and any additional
circuitry needed to display a binary image on the LED array.
We will call any image that consists of LEDs which are either
on or off as a <i>binary image</i>.
<br><Br>

<h3>Solution</h3>
So how can we display images on the display.  We will do this
by scanning the array one row at a time at a rate over 60Hz.
From left to right, lets label the columns of the array c0 to
c7.  From top to bottom label the rows of the array r0 to r7.
Now in order to illuminate the LEDs in row 5, you would set
r5=0 and all the other row values to 1.  Then in order
to light up an LED in that row you would sets its corresponding
column bit to 1.  To turn off an LED you would set its 
corresponding column bit to 0.
<br><br>

<h3>Firmware</h3>
Our algorithm will display a binary image stored in a global
array called <b>array</b>.  The rows of the LED array are
aliased to a variable called <b>r</b>.  Likewise the columns
of the LED array are aliased to a variable called <b>c</b>.
The code to set row 5 to logic 0 would look like, r[5]=0;
What follows is the pseudo code to display the binary array
on the LED array.

<br><br>
<pre>
while(1) {
    for(row=0; row<7; row++) {
        r[row]=0;
        for(col=0; col<7; col++) c[col] = array[row][column];
	delay(1/60 second);
        r[row]=1;
}   }
</pre>


<h3>Hardware</h3>
In order to operate the LED array, it should first be noted that 
you just cannot wire-up the PIC outputs to the array.  The current
capabilities would not allow the LEDs to light up to their full
potential.  Instead you should use an amplifier.  We know that a single
BJT can be used as a currently amplifier.  However, a pair of BJTs
can use used as a super current amplifier called a darlington pair.
This configuration will be shown in class to amplify the input
current by a factor of beta^2.  Now a single darlington pair would
certainly be able to source or sink the necessary current, however in
our application we need 8 of them to source current and 8 of them
to sink current.  Fortunately, Toshiba makes just the part.

<ul>	<li>
<a href="http://www.alldatasheet.co.kr/datasheet-pdf/view1/TOSHIBA/TD62783.html"> Toshiba TD62783 -- current source driver</a>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.alldatasheet.co.kr/datasheet-pdf/view1/TOSHIBA/TD62083.html">Toshiba TD62083 -- current sink driver</a>
</ul>

Now we can hook the current source driver to the columns of the array and
the sink to the rows of the array.  Well almost, we need some current
limiting resistors.  These can be hooked in series between the row
outputs and the darlington current sinks.  The resistor value should
be set to pump as much current as possible through the LED.

<h2>Gray Scale Display</h2>
Modify the firmware for the previous problem as follows.  Create
a program that can display an 8x8 gray scale image on the LED array.
A gray scale image is composed of pixels which can have one of 
256 different illumination levels, from full off to full on.  The 
global array <b>array</b> is an 8x8 array where each entry is an 8-bit
value.

<h3>Firmware</h3>
A first shot at the firmware would have a counter going from
0 to 255.  If the value store in an array index is less than
the current count then the corresponding LED should be turned
off.  This cycling through the 256 illumination levels should
be performed in a 60th of a second.  Thus, we need to scan
the entire LED array in 1/(60*256) = 1/15,360 of a second.

<br><br>
<pre>
while(1) {
    for (duty=0; duty<256; duty++) {
        for(row=0; row<7; row++) {
            r[row]=0;
            for(col=0; col<7; col++) 
		if (duty > array[row][column]) c[col]=0; else c[col]=1;
            delay(1/15,360);
            r[row]=1;
}   }   }
</pre>

Is there any improvements to the above algorithm.  It might
be nice to spread out the on and off times of an individual LED
through the duty loop.  For example lets say that LED 4,4 has
its duty cycle set to 128.  In our algorithm, this LED would be
on fir the first half of the DUTY for loop and off for the second
half of this loop.  Wouldn;t it be nicer to have the LED turn on and
off through the entire loop.  This would result in the same
illumination, but perhaps it would add a softer illumination???
