Pin Module.  Click on the Pin Manager tab in the console area.  Click
on Port C bit 0 and Port C bit 1 in the GPIO output row .  The blue open 
lock should change to a green closed lock.  Now in the Pin Module area, 
click on the Custom Name text box in the RC0 Pin Module row and change 
the name to "TEST_C0_PIN" and hit enter.  Name RC1, "TEST_C1_PIN".
<li>Click File &rarr; Save All

that the configuration has warnings, click Yes. The warning is about 
configuring CCP5 so that whenever its associated flag is set the ADC 
module performs a conversion - we will not enabling this feature, so 
we do not have to configure CCP5.
In the MCC Save Configuration File, keep the defaults and Save.
Remember that anytime that you make a change to 
the configuration you must re-generate the supporting files by clicking 
on the generate button,
<li>Click on the Project tab in the project manager window,
expand the Source Files folder and double click main.c to open 
it in the editor window,
<li>Replace the contents of main.c with 
<a href="./code/inlab09.c">inlab09.c</a>,
</ul>

<h3>MCC Read Byte Interface</h3>
A read operation from the I2C takes place in two parts, a write 
(to set the starting address) and the read.  The write operation (to 
set the starting address) happen first.  Let's take a look at the
code snippet below to see how this works.  First we declare an array
called pData, of 65 8-bit values (line r01).  The first two bytes of
pData are the populated with the I2C address (lines r02, r03). Next, 
the status flag is set for the write operation (line r04), the write to 
the I2C is performed (line r05), and the program waits for the write 
to complete (line r06).  I call this write a "no-data" write, its purpose 
is only to set the address register inside the I2C.  The address 
register is a register that stores the location of memory location that
we are going to read or write.  When you request to read data from the 
I2C, the address register contains the location of the first stored
byte to read out of the I2C.  Lastly, the status flag is set for the 
read (line r07), the read is performed (line r08), and the program waits 
for the read to complete (line r09). 


<pre>
r01.	uint8_t pData[64];

r02.	pData[0] = address>>8;
r03.    pData[1] =  (uint8_t) byteAddress;  
r04.    I2C_Wflag = I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING;
r05.    I2C2_MasterWrite(pData, 2, I2CDEVICE_I2C_ADDR, &I2C_Wflag);
r06.    while(I2C_Wflag == I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING);                       
                
r07.    I2C_Wflag = I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING;
r08.    I2C2_MasterRead(pData, 1, EI2CDEVICE_I2C_ADDR, &I2C_Wflag);
r09.    while(I2C_Wflag == I2C2_MESSAGE_PENDING);
</pre>

Let's examine what is going on between the PIC and the I2C
during this process.  To do this, we will use the I2C serial
decode function built into our Keysight oscilloscopes.  Configure
your oscilloscope as follows:


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Ch1 probe		<td>RB1 - SCL
<tr><td>Ch1 ground clip		<td>Dev board ground loop
<tr><td>Ch1 (scale) 		<td>2V
<tr><td>Ch2 probe		<td>RB2 - SDA
<tr><td>Ch2 (scale) 		<td>2V

<tr><td>Horizontal (scale) 	<td>50 us
<tr><td>Trigger mode		<td>Normal
<tr><td>Trigger source		<td>1
<tr><td>Trigger slope		<td>&darr;
<tr><td>Trigger level		<td>1.65V
</table>

Make sure to:
<ul>	<li>Align Ch 1 on the <u>third</u> lowest reticule to make room
	for the I2C decode
	<li>Align the horizontal position at the second left-most reticule,

	<li>Convert serial stream<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Mode</u> &rarr; I<sup>2</sup>C<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Serial</u> &rarr; Serial S1: I2C &check;<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Signals</u> &rarr; SCL &rarr; 1<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Signals</u> &rarr; SDA &rarr; 2<br>

	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Signals</u> &rarr; <u>Threshold</u> &rarr; (Trigger Level) &rarr; 1.65V (for both SCL and SDA)<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Address Size</u> &rarr; <u>7 Bit</u><br>
		
	<li>Clear all menus off the bottom of the screen<br>
	[&uarr;Back]
</ul>

Your scope screen should looks like the following when you perform 
a byte read.  Go ahead and experiment with the other I2C read
and write functions.  Compare when you see in PuTTY and what you
see on the oscilloscope.

<br><img src="./img/byteRead.bmp"><br><br>

The serial decode on the oscilloscope uses letters and colors
to describe the I2C bits.  Blue and Yellow text denote control 
packets, while white text is data.  Data values are represented
in hexadecimal.  Upper-case 'W' or 'R' denotes
a read or write operation.  Acknowledge bits are denoted with
'a' and no acknowledge with '~a'. 

<ol start=13>
<li>Screen shot your oscilloscope with the decoded stream for a byte read.
<li>In the following table, relate the oscilloscope serial decode information 
of an I2C from your byte read to the information contained in the 24LC256
technical documents for a random read shown in Figure 8-2.  Note that our
byte read qualifies as a random read in the technical documents.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Figure 8-2	<td>Control Byte
		<td>Address High Byte
		<td>Address Low Byte
		<td>Control Byte
		<td>Data Byte
<tr><td>Oscilloscope serial decode	
		<td>&nbsp
		<td>&nbsp
		<td>&nbsp
		<td>&nbsp
		<td>&nbsp
</table>

</ol>

<h3>MCC Byte Write Interface</h3>
Unlike a byte read from the I2C, a byte write to the I2C occurs
as a single transaction.  After the control byte is sent indicating that
the PIC wants to write to the I2C, the starting address of the write
is sent in two bytes, followed by the data.  However, the work of the
I2C really starts <u>after</u> the entire I2C packet is
received.  The I2C must commit the data into its non-volatile
memory.  This commit can take several milliseconds.  If we wanted
to perform another read or write from the I2C immediately after
this byte write, then we would need to poll the I2C, asking it
when it was done committing the byte write.  However, since this
byte write is followed by prompting the user for input from the 
terminal, there is plenty of time for the byte write to commit,
hence in this case we do not poll the I2C to determine if it
has committed the byte write to its non-volatile memory.
<br><br>

Go ahead and perform a byte write operation from PuTTY and observe
the decoded serial data stream at the bottom of the oscilloscope.
The following is an example oscilloscope capture.

<br><img src="./img/byteWrite.bmp"><br><br>

<ol start=15>
<li>Screen shot your oscilloscope with the decoded stream for a byte write.
<li>In the following table, relate the oscilloscope serial decode information 
of an I2C from your byte write to the information contained in the 24LC256
technical documents for a random write as shown in Figure 6-1.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
