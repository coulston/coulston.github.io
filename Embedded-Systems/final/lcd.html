<h1>LCD control</h1>
Today we will explore the functionality of the Lumex Opto/Components 
Inc. LCM-S01602DTR/A.  This LCD consists of two parts; a LCD 
(made by Lumex) and a controller chip (made by Samsung).  The LCD 
is the glass stuff that you see characters on.  The LCD contains 
something like 80 wires that are used to draw all pixels of all the
characters and refresh the display.  The controller chip reduces all
this control information down to 14-pins that will be wired into
your bread board via a 14-pin header.  


The LCM-S01602DTR/A product page can be found at

associated with our LCD by clicking the link for our LCD.  You will
note that these are more focused on the mechanical aspects of the 
LCD and its pin out.  Make sure that you have a copy of page 2 handy
when it comes time to wire up your LCD to your PIC.

What you really want to know is how to communicate with the LCD
and make it do interesting stuff.  Towards this end you will need
to examine the chip which draws stuff on the LCD, called the LCDs
controller chip.  Our LCD has a Samsung controller chip.  The technical 
documentation for this driver can be found at the bottom of our LCDs page:

In its simplest form the LCD is just an 80 (decimal) character RAM.  The
ASCII code of the contents of a memory location correspond to the character
displayed in that location.  To see the exact characters consult the 
Samsung CG Table table at
<a href="http://www.lumex.com/tech_notes/drivers/samsungCGRom.pdf">
http://www.lumex.com/tech_notes/drivers/samsungCGRom.pdf</a>.
Note in this table the 8-bit binary code
for a character is given as "H" and "L" which stand for logic 1 and 0
respectively.  For example, the binary code for the character "Z" is
0x5A.  Each of the memory locations has a logical
position in the LCD's memory space.  The logical arrangement of memory
locations are shown in the figure below.

All the address in this figure are in decimal. Since the LCD's physical
display is 16 columns by 2 rows then only a portion of the logical
display can be seen at a time.  The viewable region will be called the
"window" on the LCD's memory.  The LCD interface is specified by the
following 4 types of signals.  As we will see latter
the window can be shifted without shifting the data in the LCD.  As
shown in the figure above, the window is in the "home" position.

There are two types of instructions that you can give to the 
LCD, configuration and data.  Data values are just the character
you want displayed.  Configuration instructions change the
way the LCD displays information.  You can change the Address
counter, the point to where the next character is displayed.
You can clear the display.  The LCD can be configured to run in
4-bit mode, a mode allowing data to be transfered in 2, 4-bit nibbles.
This can save you 4-data line at the expense of slower data 
transfer to the LCD.
