<h2>External Hardware</h2>
To answer the following questions you will need to consult the 
<a href="./HCSR04.pdf">HCSR04 - Ultra-Sonic Ranging Module HC-SR04 Technical Specification</a>.
The speed of sound has some relationship to the elevation at which it is
measured.  Within a reasonable degree of accuracy, the speed of sound 
in Golden Colrado is 334 m/s.  Use this value in your calculations.

<ol>
<li>Given a range of x centimeters from the ultrasonic sensor to an
object, determine the duration of the echo pulse generated by the ultrasonic
sensor in milliseconds.  Remember that the acoustic pulse emitted by the 
ultrasonic sensor must travel out to the object and then reflect back to the 
sensor.  The echo pulse is held high during the flight time (out and back)
of this acoustic pulse.  Use dimensional analysis and show your work for 
full credit.

<li>The working range of the ultrasonic sensor is 10cm to 500cm.  Determine 
the duration of the echo pulse (in milliseconds) for an object placed at
these two distances away from the ultrasonic sensor.  Use dimensional
anslysis and show your work for full credit.

<li>Assuming that we are measuring the duration of the echo pulse using
a 16-bit timer, what is the smallest prescaler that can be used to 
measure the duration of the echo pulse.

<li>Given an echo pulse of x milliseconds generated by the ultrasonic 
sensor, determine the range (in centimeters) from the object to the 
ultrasonic sensor.  Use dimensional analysis and show your work for 
full credit.

<li>Find the HC-SR04 - Ultra-Sonic Ranger technical documents
found on the Digikey web site.  Hint, search for "HC-SR04" on
the Digikey web site. What is the minimum duration of the pulse
on the trigger input? 

</ol>

<h2>Internal Subsystem</h2>
Discuss capture subsystem, rising and falling edge.
Interrupt subsystem.

<ol start=6>
<li>Given an echo pulse of duration x timer counts with the timer 
configured with a 1:8 prescaler, find the distance in centimeters
to the object.  Use dimensional analysis for full credit.
Note, the constant relating timer counts to centimeters will be called the
<u>conversion factor</u>.
</li>

Let's say that you measured the duration of the echo pulse using a 
1:8 prescaled timer and stored the number of timer counts in a variable 
called <font face="courier">timerCounts</font>.  I want you to convert the 
timer counts into a distance (in centimeters) by multiplyng by the
conversion factor determined in the previous problem.  We will use 0.008
as the approximation in the following discussion, but you should use the
true value determined in the previous problem.  To summarize I would the
equivlent of the following line of code in your program:
<br>
<font face="courier">distanceInCm = 0.008 * timerCounts;</font>
<br>
However since we are not allow to use floating point math on the PIC, we 
will need to find an alternative.<br><br>


The idea will be to multiply the conversion factor by 2<sup>16</sup>,
mutiple the result with timerCounts and then divide by 2<sup>16</sup>.
In other words:
<br>
<font face="courier">distanceInCm = ((2<sup>16</sup>*0.008) * timerCounts)/2<sup>16</sup>;</font>
<br>

Since we are multiplying and then dividing by the same factor (2<sup>16</sup>),
the factors cancel leaving us with the same answer as if we had just
multiplied by 0.008.  However, the advantage is that the product
2<sup>16</sup>*0.008 = 524 (rounded to nearest integer) which is easy
to multiply by timerCounts using regular integer math.  Then the division
by 2<sup>16</sup> can be accomplished by shifting right by 16-bits using
the C shift operation.
<li>Write a C-code snippet to convert timerCounts into distance in
centimeters.
</ol>



<h2>Firmware Organization</h2>
Build a project using the following MCC configuration:

<ul>
<li>In the INTERNAL OSCILLATOR area of the System Module window
<ul>	<li>Oscillator Select:	Internal oscillator block
	<li>System Clock Select: FOSC
	<li>Internal Clock: 16MHz_HFINTOSC
	<li>Software PLL Enabled: Check
</ul>
The Current System clock should be 64MHz (4x PLL)

<li>In the Pin Manager: Grid [MCC] tab of the console window
click on the open lock in the Port C 7 column and in the output row.

<li>In the Project Resources area of the project window, click 
"Pin Module".  The editor window will change from the System Module to
Pin Module. Click on the Custom Name text box in the RC7 row and change 
the name to "TRIG_PIN".
<li>If selected, unselect Analog and WPU.

<li>In the Device Resources area of the project window, expand the Timer
option.  Double click TMR0.
<li>In the Device Resources area of the project window, expand the EUSART
option.  Double click EUSART2.
<li>In the Device Resources area of the project window, expand the CCP
option.  Double click CCP4
<li>In the Device Resources area of the project window, expand the Timer
option.  Double click TMR1.

<li>In the Project Resources area of the project window, expand the 
Peripherals option if not already expanded, and click on TMR0.
<ul>	<li>Enable Timer:	&check;
	<li>Enable Prescaler:	&check;
	<li>Prescaler:		1:32
	<li>Timer mode:		16-bit
	<li>Clock Source:	FOSC/4
	<li>Enable Timer Interrupt:	&check;
	<li>Requested Period:	120ms
</ul>

<li>In the Project Resources area of the project window click on EUSART2.
<ul>	<li>Enable EUSART:	&check;
	<li>Enable Transmit:	&check;
	<li>Enable Wake-up:	&square;
	<li>Auto-Baud Detection:	&square;

	<li>Enable Continous Receive:	&check;
	<li>Enable EUSART Interuupts:	&square;
	<li>Redirect STDIO to USART	&check;
</ul>

<li>In the Project Resources area of the project window click on CCP4.
<ul>	<li>ECCP mode:			Capture
	<li>Capture Timer Select:	Timer1
	<li>Capture mode:		Every rising edge
	<li>Enable CCP interrupt:	&square;
</ul>

<li>In the Project Resources area of the project window click on TMR1.
<ul>	<li>Enable Timer:	&check;
	<li>Clock Source:	FOSC/4
	<li>Prescaler:		1:8
	<li>Enable Synchronization:	&check;
	<li>Timer Period:	32.768 ms
	<li>Period count:	0xFFFF
</ul>
</ul>


<li>Click on the "Generate" button in the Project Resources area of the
project manager window.  In the MCC Save Configuration File, keep the 
defaults and Save.  Anytime that you make a change to the configuration
you must re-generate the supporting files by clicking on the generate
button,
<li>Click on the Project tab in the project manager window,
expand the Source Files folder and double click main.c to open 
it in the editor window.
<li>Replace the contents of main.c with 
<a href="./code/inlab05.c">inlab05.c</a>,
<li>Click on the Project tab in the project manager window,
expand the Source Files folder, expand the MCC Generated Files folder
and double click tmr0.c to open it in the editor window.
<li>Scroll down to the void TMR0_DefaultInterruptHandler(void)
function (on line 158), and delete the entire function (remove
lines 158 - 161).  We are doing this because we have defined this
function, TMR0_DefaultInterruptHandler, in main.

<li>Compile and download the code to the PIC,
<li>Move the slide switch from PROG to VCOM, this is easy to forget!

<li>Wire up the ultrasonic range finder to the PIC using 4 jumper wires
according to the splash screen instructions guide.  In order to provide
power (Vcc) to the range finder you will need to remove the power jumper
from JP1 and connect the jumper wire to the pin closest to the USB mini
connector.  It should look something like the following; this setup will 
enable you to move the range finder while keeping the Dev'17 board still. 
Experiment with the range finder and terminal application by pointing 
the range finder at nearby vertical surfaces and observing the values 
returned by the program.  You may experience interference if your 
neighbors at the lab bench are also experimenting.
</ul>
<br><img src="./img/ultraSonic.jpg"><br><br>

Let's examine the structure of the firmware before moving on with this
lab.  In the Project area of the project window, expand the
Source File folder then expand the MCC Generated Files folder.
<ol start=8>
<li>Open the MCC generated file interrupt_manager.c, what function is
called when timer 0 is enabled and when timer 0 has rolled over? 

<li>At the start of main the function "SYSTEM_Initialize" is called.  
Look through the MCC generated files to find this function.  What
file is this function call defined in and list the initialization 
functions that SYSTEM_Initialize function calls.

<li>Look through the MCC generated files to find the TMR0_SetInterruptHandler 
function.  The argument to TMR0_SetInterruptHandler is a function 
pointer; that is the name of a function!  In the body of 
TMR0_SetInterruptHandler the function passed into the TMR0_SetInterruptHandler
function is aliased to "TMR0_InterruptHandler."  So if you called
"TMR0_SetInterruptHandler(pugs);" where pugs was a subroutine that you
defined (say in your main.c file), then a call to TMR0_InterruptHandler();
would call the pugs function.
<br>

Find the TMR0_Initialize function, what is the name of the function that
is passed into the TMR0_SetInterruptHandler function?  In what source file 
is this function defined?  What does this function do?
</ol>

After setting up the subsystems using MCC, you may find that you need
to modify a setting.  This may require MCC to modify an existing 
generate file.  When this happens you will have to work with the
MCC Diff Checking Tool.  The diff checking tool presents you with a 
new version of the file and the old version of the file, allowing
you to make decisions about weather to incorperate changes or not.
To understand this better, let's look at a practical example of
making changes to the timer 0 configuration.

<ul>
<li>If MCC is not open, in the Project tab of the project management
window open the Important Files folder and double clicl on the mc3
file.  After MCC opens, 
<li>click on the Resources tab in the project management window.  In the 
Project Resources area open Peripherals selection and select TMR0,
<li>Change the "Requested Period" field to 100ms,
<li>Save the configuration: File &rarr; Save All,
<li>Click Generate in the Project Resources area of the project management
window,
<li>You should see the the following merge window.  
<br><img src="./img/merge.jpg"><br>

<li> Clicking on the blue insert arrow will move the new changes you made 
in the configuration
to the MCC generated file, tmr0.c.  In this case we want to move the
new initial timer 0 value into tmr0.c so that the timer interupts every
100ms instead of 120ms. 
<li>Looking that the scroll bar to the right of the Merge Result subwindow 
shows that there is one red merge, scroll down to that difference.  You
should see the following:
<br><img src="./img/merge02.jpg"><br><br>
<li>This difference is telling us that MCC wants to add an (empty)
declaration for the TMR0_DefaultInterruptHandler function.  However, in a 
previous step we moved that function into main so that we could more
easily edit it.  Because you cannot have two definitions for a function,
we will reject this suggested modification.  To do this simply ignore
the suggestion by <u>not</u> clicking on the blue arrow.
<li>Save the changes to tmr0.c by clicking File &rarr; Save All
<li>Close the difference checking tool by clicking on the x in the
merge tab.
</ul>

<h2>Firmware Experiments</h2>
Lay a 30 centimeter-long piece of tape down on the lab bench.  Mark
off 2 cm intervals along the length of the tape.  Place the ultrasonic
range finder transducer along the 0 cm mark.  You will be placing a
solid hard surface along the length of the tape so that the ultrasonic
acoustic pulse better reflect.
<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Capture an echo pulse with a hard reflective object placed at 20cm
away from the ultrasonic range finder.  To do this setup the oscilloscope 
as follows:
<li>Connect a proper oscilloscope probe to channel 1 of the oscilloscope,
<li>Connect the ground clip of the oscilloscope probe to the ground loop 
on your Dev'17 board,
<li>Connect the oscilloscope channel 1 probe to the ultrasoncic range finder 
	right-angle header pin labeled "Trig",
<li>Set the vertical scale for channel 1 to 1 volts per division by 
	adjusting the large, leftmost vertical knob to 1.00V/division,
<li>Move the channel 1 ground reference to the second lowest reticule on the 
	lower half screen by adjusting the small channel 1 vertical knob,

<li>Connect the oscilloscope channel 2 probe to the range finder right-
	angle header pin labeled "Echo",
<li>Set the vertical scale for channel 2 to 1 volts per division by 
	adjusting the large, leftmost vertical knob to 1.00V/division,
<li>Move the channel 2 ground reference to the second lowest reticule on the 
	upper half screen by adjusting the small channel 2 vertical knob,

<li>Set the horziontal scale to 2.5 ms per division by 
	adjusting the large horziontal knob to 2.5 ms/division,
<li>Move the horizontal trigger reference to the second leftmost reticule,
	by adjusting the small horziontal knob so that orange indicator at

<li>Include the screenshot from the waveform save on your oscilloscope
when an object is placed about 1 meter away.

<li>Using the time per division information on the oscilloscope screen
and the duration the waveform (described in divisions), show your 
calculation for the period of the waveform on the echo line by multiplying 
the time division setting by the number of division of the echo pulse.
For example, if your oscilloscope was set to 20ms/division and the 
waveform had a duration of 4.6 divisions, then your answer would look 
like:
<pre>
Oscilloscope set to 20ms/division
The duration of the waveform is 4.6 divisions

	  20ms        
	-------- *  4.6 divisions = 92ms
	division

<li>Modify the convertEchoToCm function using your conversion math
from a previous answer.  Show the complete function as your answer.

<li>Complete the table below by placing a hard reflective object at the
distance given in the "Actual distance" column.  Follow the following
instructions to complete the remaining columns in the table.
<ul>
<li>Measure the duration of the echo pulse (in timer counts using the "s") 
and enter it into the "Echo duration" column below.
<li>Use your answer to questions above to convert the Echo counts 
into distances (in cm).  For each echo count, enter the corresponding 
distance (to 3 significnt figures) into the "Calculated distance" column below. 
<li>For each row in the table below, compute the % error between the 
actual distance of the object and calculated distance in the "Calculated
distance (cm)" column and enter it in the "% error" column.
<li>Finally record the distance reported by the convertEchoToCm function
statement in the column "convertEchoToCm".
