<h2>InLab5</h3>
Word process your answers to these questions. Title your solutions 
"InLab5 Solutions", include the date and the time when the lab 
session begins, and both team members names. Solutions should be 
numbered, formatted neatly, and when applicable written in complete 
English sentences with punctuation. Turn in the solutions to the
following questions by the end of today's lab session.  <br><br>


<h3>LCD</h3>
Today we will explore the functionality of the Crystalfontz America,
Inc. 
<a href="http://www.crystalfontz.com/products/1602b-wt/datasheets/936/CFAH1602BNGGJTV_v1.0.pdf">CFAH1602B-NGG-JTV</a>.   
LCD.  This link points to the technical documents for the display.  What
you are primary concerned with is 
What you really want to know is how to communicate with the LCD
and make it do interesting stuff. 

<ol>
<li>Use the Module Classification Information on page 4 of the 
Crystalfontz documents to give a complete description of the characters
which form the string "CFAH1602B-NGG-JTV".

<li>Go to page 12 of the CFAH1602B-NGG-JTV technical documents.
Make a table with 16 rows and 4 rows.  The table header should be
LCD pin#, Symbol, PIC pin, description.  Use the Spring Board
<a href="http://ecse.bd.psu.edu/cmpen352/lab/lab3/SpringSch.html">
schematic</a> to help with the PIC pin reference.

<li>Examine <a href="lab5.h">lab5.h</a>, and correct the 
definitions of the LCD I/O pins.  Show the corrected definitions.

<li>Read pages 37 of the CFAH1602B-NGG-JTV technical documents.
Describe the role of the two registers in the LCD in your own
words.  
What roles does the RS bit serve when interacting with these two registers?
What roles does the R/W bit serve when interacting with these two registers?
Complete English sentences, please.

<li>Read page 58 of the CFAH1602B-NGG-JTV technical documents.
Write a sequence of instructions which writes a value to the 
CONTROL register in the display.  You should use the lab5.h defines. 

<pre>
	// Write data to the display
	TRIS_LCD_DATA = value;
	E_PIN = value;
	RS_PIN = value;
	RW_PIN = value;
	LCD_DATA = value;
	// A small delay here of a couple of clock cycles will allow 
	// the signals to stabalize, at most Delay10TCY(1)
	
	other stuff from the timeing diagram....
</pre>

<li>Read page 58 of the CFAH1602B-NGG-JTV technical documents.
Write a sequence of instructions which reads a value to the display.
You should examine the lab5.h file for the defines 

<pre>
	// Read data from the display
	TRIS_LCD_DATA = value;
	E_PIN = value;
	RS_PIN = value;
	RW_PIN = value;
	LCD_DATA = value;
	// A small delay here of a couple of clock cycles will allow 
	// the signals to stabalize, at most Delay10TCY(1)
	
	other stuff from the timeing diagram....
</pre>

<li>Download and open the MCC18 compiler 
<a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MPLAB_C18_Libraries_51297f.pdf">MPLAB-C18-Libraries.pdf</a>
file.  Goto to section on the Delay functions.
For each of the 5 delay fuctions listed, calculate the number of instruction
clock cycles of each delay.
for:
<ul>	<li>Delay1TCY()
	<li>Delay10TCY(5)
	<li>Delay100TCY(5)
	<li>Delay1KTCY(5)
	<li>Delay10KTCY(5)
</ul>


<li>Make the lab5 project (instructions are at the bottom of this page).
Download on your Spring Board.  Hook an O'scope to the RC2 pin (the one
next to the IR LED would be convienent).  Measure the period of the
waveform.  Using this information to determine the length (in time) of
1 instruction cycle.  Round your answer to a reasonablly close value.

<li>Using the instruction cycle time calculated in the previous 
problem to determine the minimum and  maximum delay that you can create 
with each of the 5 delay fucntions?

<li>Read page 45 of the CFAH1602B-NGG-JTV technical documents.
Assume that you have a "LCD_WRITE" instruction like that described in 
<a href="http://ecse.bd.psu.edu/cmpen352/lab/lab5/lab5.html">lab5</a>,
and you have the delay fucntions defined in the delays.h library.  Write
a program to initialize the display.  Read page 51 for the sequence
of instructions necessary to initialize the LCD.  Your initialization
program will look like.  CONTROL_WRITE needs to be defined in the 
LCD.h file.
<pre>
	// Initialization sequence
	DELAY100TCY(value);			// Power-up delay?
	LCD_WRITE(CONTROL_WRITE, value)		// function set
	DELAY100TCY(value);			// Wait ??uS
	LCD_WRITE(CONTROL_WRITE, value)		// function set
	DELAY100TCY(value);			// Wait ??uS
	LCD_WRITE(CONTROL_WRITE, value)		// display ON/OFF control
	DELAY100TCY(value);			// Wait ??uS
	LCD_WRITE(CONTROL_WRITE, value)		// display clear
	DELAY100TCY(value);			// Wait ??mS
	LCD_WRITE(CONTROL_WRITE, value)		// entry mode set
	DELAY100TCY(value);			// Really should wait here
	
</pre>
