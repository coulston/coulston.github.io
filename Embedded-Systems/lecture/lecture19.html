<h1>Analog to Digital Conversion</h1>
The PIC has an analog to digital converter (ADC) subsystem which takes 
an analog input between 0 and 3.3v and converts the analog voltage into number,
called the <u>converted value</u> between 0 and 1023.  The conversion 
from voltage to number is ratiometric, meaning that the output is 
directly proportional to the input.  

<h2>Ratiometric</h2>
Ratiometric means that the ratio of the input voltage to 3.3v is the same
as the ratio of the converted value to 1024.  The leftmost graph below 
shows the input voltage vs. the converted value.  In reality the graph
is not a smooth line, but the orange staircase going upwards every 
&alpha; = 3.3v/1024.  The first half step allows the transition from
converted value 0b000 to 0b001 to occur at the half-way point between 
0v and &alpha;v.  The ideal transfer function shows how the input voltage
is converted by an ADC with an infinite number of bits - every analog
input voltage would have its own unique binary representation on the
output.

<br><img src="./img/adcRatio.jpg"><br><br>

Let's apply the definition of ratiometric to a pair of problems.<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>Question:</b>Say the PIC ADC input is at 1v input, what is the 
converted value? <br>

<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
   3.3v   1 v
   ---- = ---      x = 310.3
   1024    x

However, we cannot have a fractional answer so the ADC will round the
converted value to the nearest integer resulting in a converted value of 310.
</pre>

<li><b>Question:</b>Your program reads a converted value of 842 in the PIC's
ADC subsystem.  What analog voltage is present on the input?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
   3.3v   x v
   ---- = ---      x = 2.71 v
   1024   842
</pre>
<br>
</ul>

<h2>Converter resolution</h2>
When you work with other microcontrollers you will not doubt
find that they have different number of bits.  The number of bits
produced in the converted value is called the resolution of the
ADC.  A <u>count</u> is a one unit change in the converted 
value.   So a N-bit ADC has 2<sup>N</sup> counts in its full range.
<br><br>

Fundamentally, changing the resolution of the ADC changes the scale
on the vertical axis of the ratiometric graph shown above.  So all
we need to do to determine converted values is to change the
"2<sup>10</sup>" in the graph with "2<sup>N</sup>", where N is the
resolution of the ADC.<br>

Let's start our exploration of this concept by examining 
a straight forward question.

<ul>
<li><b>Question:</b>How many bits does the PIC use to represent the
converted value?<br>
<b>Answer:</b>Since the result is in the range of 0-1023, 10-bits
is sufficient to represent the converted value.

<li><b>Question:</b> You are using an ADC with 12-bit resolution and a 
3.3v reference that has an analog input of 1v, what is the converted value?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
   3.3v   1 v
   ---- = ---      x = 1,241
   2<sup>12</sup>    x
</pre><br>


<li><b>Question:</b> Your program reads a converted value of 842 on a 
14-bit ADC that is using a 3.3v reference. What analog voltage is present 
on the input?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
   3.3 v    x v
   ----- = ---      x = 0.17 v
   2<sup>14</sup>      842
</pre>



<li><b>Question:</b>Say you are using an ADC with a 3-bit resolutions
and a 3.3 V and 0 V input voltage range, what is the converted value for
the following inputs?<br>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Input voltage	<td>converted value
<tr><td>0.4125 V	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>0.4254 V	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>0.6188 V	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>0.7219 V	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>0.825  V	<td>&nbsp

</table>

<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
   3.3 v   0.625 v
   ----- = -------	x = (0.4125  * 8) / 3.3 = 1
    2^3     x
			x = (0.4254  * 8) / 3.3 = 1.25, round to 1
			x = (0.6188  * 8) / 3.3 = 1.5,  round to 2
			x = (0.7219  * 8) / 3.3 = 1.75, round to 2
			x = (0.825   * 8) / 3.3 = 2
</pre>

<li><b>Question:</b>Say you are using an ADC with a 3-bit resolutions
and a 3.3 V and 0 V voltage reference, what analog input is associated
with each of the following converted values?<br>


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Converted Value	<td>Analog Input
<tr><td>0		<Td>&nbsp
<tr><td>1		<Td>&nbsp
<tr><td>2		<Td>&nbsp
<tr><td>3		<Td>&nbsp
<tr><td>4		<Td>&nbsp
<tr><td>5		<Td>&nbsp
<tr><td>6		<Td>&nbsp
<tr><td>7		<Td>&nbsp
</table>

<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
   3.3 v    x v
   ----- = -------	x = 0 * 3.3V / 8 = 0
    2^3      0
			x = 1 * 3.3V / 8 = 0.413 V
			x = 2 * 3.3V / 8 = 0.825 V
			x = 3 * 3.3V / 8 = 1.238 V
			x = 4 * 3.3V / 8 = 1.65  V
			x = 5 * 3.3V / 8 = 2.063 V
			x = 6 * 3.3V / 8 = 2.475 V
			x = 7 * 3.3V / 8 = 2.888 V
</pre>

</ul>


<h2>Voltage references</h2>
We started this section by having the PIC converts voltages
between 0v and 3.3v.  The minimum and maximum voltage for an ADC are
called the reference potentials.  You can configure the PIC to use two pins 
V<sub>ref</sub>- (RA2) and V<sub>ref</sub>+ (RA3) as the A/D reference 
potentials and on our development board, these pins are connected to 10k&ohm;
resistors to 3.3v through the two push buttons.   If you did not press
the push buttons, you could ties these two pins to other voltages to
change the reference potentials on the PIC.  You could do this 
in order to decrease the quantization error.  Let's examine two examples 
that will help us better understand this concept.

<ul>
<li><b>Question:</b>The PIC has 0v and 3.3v reference potentials,
determine the converted value for 2.2V.<br>

<b>Answer:</b> 

<pre>
   3.3 V   2.2 V
   ----- = -----      x = 683
   1024      x
</pre>
<br>


<li><b>Question:</b>
Set V<sub>ref</sub>- = 1v and V<sub>ref</sub>+ to 3v, determine the 
converted value for 2.2V.<br>

<b>Answer:</b> 

<pre>
   (3 V - 1 V)    (2.2 V - 1.0 V)
   ------------ = ---------------      x = 614
       1024              x
</pre>

<li><b>Question:</b>You are working with a 12-bit ADC with 1 V and 3 V 
reference potentials, determine the converted value for 1.8V.<br>

<b>Answer:</b> 

<pre>
   (3 V - 1 V)    (1.8 V - 1.0 V)
   ------------ = ---------------      x = 1638
       2^12              x
</pre>
</ul>


<h2>Quantization error</h2>
This process of converting an analog voltage to a digital value is commonly
called <u>quantization</u>.  Related to the concept of quantization is
<u>quantization error</u>.  Quantization error is measured in terms of
input volts and is the amount of rounding error, typically &half; of the
least significant bit, or &half; count.   You could also think about it
as the worst case difference between an input voltage and the 
converted value's corresponding analog input voltage.  A third way to
think about quantization error is to ask, "how far off can the converted 
value be in representing the actual analog input?"
Let's look at a numerical value to understand this definition better. 
<br><br>

Say you are using an ADC with a 3-bit resolution with 3.3 V and 0 V reference
voltages and apply an input of 0.4254 V.  Looking at some of the previous
work performed in this lecture, we see that a 0.4254 V input has a
converted value of 1.25 which is rounded to 1.  The difference between the
true output of 1.25 and the actual output of 1.0, when represented in terms
of the input voltage corresponds to 0.4254 V - 0.4125 V = 0.0129 V which is
the quantization error for an input voltage of 0.4254.  Different input
voltages will have different quantization errors.  An important value is
the worst case quantization error; it is typically this value that is 
quoted when you read a quantization error specification for an ADC.
In order to determined this worst-case quantization error you need to find 
the maximum rounding error in the converted value for an input voltage.
To help with this, let's plot the data we created for the
3-bit ADC from a previous section.<br><Br>

Say you are using an ADC with a 3-bit resolutions
and a 3.3 V and 0 V input voltage range, what analog input is associated
with each of the following converted values?  We found the answer to be:
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Converted Value	<td>Analog Input
<tr><td>0		<Td>0 V
<tr><td>1		<Td>0.413 V
<tr><td>2		<Td>0.825 V
<tr><td>3		<Td>1.238 V
<tr><td>4		<Td>1.65 V
<tr><td>5		<Td>2.063 V
<tr><td>6		<Td>2.475 V
<tr><td>7		<Td>2.888 V
</pre>

</table>

The following figure plots this data as red dots on a graph with the 
analog input voltage on the horizontal axis and the converted value 
on the vertical axis.  The black lines on the graph represent the 
<u>converted values rounded to the nearest integer.</u> In order to 
better understand the black line, the analog input and converted 
values from a previous question are annotated on the graph.

<br> <img src="./img/adcQuantError.bmp"><br><Br>

Now this graph can help you to better understand quantization error.
Quantization error is the maximum amount of rounding error in the 
converted value represented in terms of the input.  Looking at this
graph, the maximum rounding error occurs when the converted value
jumps to a new value.  For example an analog input of 0.6188 V generates
a fractional converted value of 1.5 that is rounded to 2.  The converted
value misrepresents the true converted value by 0.5 "bits"  Since
quantization error is represented in terms of the input voltage, let's
convert ask how much input voltage corresponds to half a bit using our
familiar ratiometric equation.

<pre>

   3.3v   x v
   ---- = ----		x = 0.5 * 3.3V / 8 = 0.20625 V
    2^3   0.5

</pre>

So the quantization error of an 3-bit ADC with reference voltages 0 V
and 3.3V is 0.20625 V.<br><br>

Any way you look at it, the input analog voltage can change by at most the
equivalent of &half;LSB without a change in the converted value.  This
&half;LSB equivalent on the input is the quantization error.

<ul>

<li><b>Question:</b>What is the quantization error of PIC?<Br>
<b>Answer:</b> 

Now let's return to our problem of finding the quantization error.
Since we are looking for the voltage corresponding to a change of
&half; of a bit, let's just find the voltage that corresponds to 0.5 bits.

<pre>
   3.3 v   x v
   ----- = ---      x = 1.61 mV
    1024   0.5
</pre>

Thus the quantization error is 1.61 mV, pretty small stuff.

<li>What is the quantization error for an PIC with 1 V and 3 V reference 
potentials?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> 

<pre>
   (3 V - 1 V)   x V
   ----------- = ----	x = 0.98 mV
       1024      0.5
</pre>


<li><b>Question:</b>

analog to digital converter for different resolutions.
