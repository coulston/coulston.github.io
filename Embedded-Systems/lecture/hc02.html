<h1>Assembly conditional statements</h1>
We will use the term <u>code body</u> to mean zero or more assembly 
instructions.  Often a code body is identified by a <u>label</u>, a
symbolic name that starts in the leftmost column and is terminated
with a colon.  The label is placed to the left of the first 
assembly instruction in the body.  When used as an operand, a label
is interpreted as the address of the first instruction to follow the
label.  Normally, the processor executes
one assembly instruction after another in sequential order.  We will 
use the verb <u>jump</u> to refer to the situation when the processor
executes an instruction other than the next instruction in sequence.  
Labels are a very convenient way to tell the processor where you want 
it to jump to.
<br><br>

Conditional statements allow the processor to execute one of potentially
many different code bodies based on the value(s) of data items.  The
conditional statements in the HCS12 need to identify the data item,
the condition, and the target of the jump.



<h2>Check if a bit in a memory location is set</h2>

<pre>
	; You can declare constants in your program using the "DC" directive
varX:   DC.B    $F8           ; +248 unsigned    -8 signed

	; The BRSET is a branch to label if selected bit is set
	BRSET   varX, %00000001, ODD
EVEN:	NOP
	BRA     NEXT
ODD:	NOP           
NEXT:	NOP
</pre>

Notice that the BRSET command did not use the "#" symbol for an 
immediate operand.  This is because the reference to "varX" in the
assembly statement 
<font face="courier">BRSET varX, %00000001, ODD</font> references
the address of the memory location which contains $F8.  This is really
easy to mess up in practice.  One clue that you've added an unnecessary
"#" in front of a symbolic label is the warning:
<pre>
Warning: A12003: Value is truncated to one byte.
Warning: A1415: Cutting constant: Value ... is not in range ...
</pre>


<h2>Classic If/Then</h2>
An if/then statement has two main parts, the <u>conditional</u> 
and the body.  It allows you to execute the code in the body based
on the truth of the conditional statement.   Let's start with a
the basic C statement:
<font face="courier">if (Left > Right) D = 0x0B0B else D = 0x0A0A;</font>
and write the associated assembly code. 

<pre>
Right:	    DC.B    $2A
Left:	    DC.B    $3E

ifThen:     LDAA    Left        ; Load A with left operand
            CMPA    Right       ; memory has second operand
            BHI     ifBody      ; Branch to ifBody if Left > Right

elseBody:   LDD     #$0A0A      ; This is the body of the ELSE case
            BRA     done        ; Jump over the IF case
            
ifBody:     LDD     #$0B0B      ; This is the body of the IF case

done:	    NOP
</pre>

You should use this assembly template as the starting point to write
any if/then.  
<ul>
<li>Store the value on the right side of the inequality in memory,
<li>Store the value on the left side of the inequality in the A register,
<li>Call the "CMPA &ltmemory&gt" instruction where &ltmemory&gt is
	the address of the right side value,
<li>Call a conditional branch instruction that reflects the inequality
	between the left and right values,
<li>Set the operand of the conditional branch to the label of the if
	body.  The else body immediately follows the conditional branch
	because it needs to execute when the if condition was not met.
	The last statement of the else body is a "BRA" branch over the
	if body.  The if body should be placed immediately after the 
	else body.
</ul>

The "BHI" instruction is one of six conditional branch instructions (see
the table below for the complete list (Note, BRA is not conditional)).  
All conditional branch instructions will use the result of the preceding 
"CMP" instruction to change the PC to the next instruction or to the 
address given as the operand to the branch instruction.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Mnemonic <td>Function			<td>Condition	
	<Td>Long 
<tr><td>BHI	<td>Branch if higher		<td>A >  Memory    
	<td>LBHI
<tr><td>BHS	<td>Branch if higher or same	<td>A >= Memory  
	<td>LBHS
<tr><td>BLO	<td>Branch if lower		<td>A <  Memory 
	<td>LBLO
<tr><td>BLS	<td>Branch if lower or same	<td>A <= Memory
	<td>LBLS
<tr><td>BEQ	<td>Branch if equal		<td>A == Memory 
	<td>LBEQ
<tr><td>BNE	<td>Branch if not equal		<td>A != Memory 
	<td>LBNE
<tr><td>BRA	<td>Branch always 		<td>none
	<td>LBRA
</table>


Most of the time you will use the branch instruction mnemonics,
that start with the letter "B".  These branches can move the
program counter up to +/-128 bytes from the branch instructions. 
Sine the target of the jump is limited, these are often called short
branches.  If your branch label is further away, you will need to use the 
corresponding long branch instruction shown in the rightmost column.  Long 
branches are able to move the PC +/- 32,768 bytes from the address of the 
long branch.  The reason for having the two different types is that the 
branches is that the short branch only requires two bytes for its machine
code while the long branch requires four bytes.
<br><br>

In assembly language you will frequently come across cases where
you need to transform the condition to more efficiently perform
the conditional branch. Let's take the following C-code example:

<pre>
	if (varX8 > varY8 -5) 
	    varZ8 = 22;
	else
	    varZ8 = 33;
</pre>

When you write the assembly code for this C snippet, it is
more convenient to compute the value of "varY8-5" first and
store the result in an accumulator.  In order to use the If/Then assembly
template above we should make "varY8-5" is the left term
in the inequality.  This would generate the following code which is 
logically identical to the preceding C-code snippet.

<pre>
	if (varY8 -5 < varX8) 
	    varZ8 = 22;
	else
	    varZ8 = 33;
</pre>

The assembly code for this second form  looks like:
<pre>
		LDAA	varY8		; A <- M[varY8]
		LDAB	#5		; B <- 5
		SBA			; A <- A - B = M[varY8] - 5
		CMPA	varX8	
		BLO	ifBody		; If  (M[varY8] - 5)  < varX8

thenBody:	LDAA	#33
		STAA	varZ8
		BRA	done

ifBody:		LDAA	#22
		STAA	varZ8

done:		NOP
</pre>


<h3>Complex conditions</h3>
You may encounter cases where your assembly code needs an if/then 
the more than one condition joined by relational operators.  Take
the following example.

<pre>
	if ((varX8 > 25) ||  (varY8 != 0x34)) 
		varZ8 = 0x11;
</pre>

The assembly code uses a couple of tricks to realize this 
C-code snippet.

<ul>	<li>Since both inequalities have constants on the right side,
	we will flip them around to form the equivalent inequalities
	(25 < varX8) and  (0x34 != varY8).
	<li>Each inequality is checked on its own.  If the first 
	inequality (25 < varX8) is false then the code drops through
	to check the second inequality.
	<li>There is no else body so if the second inequality 
	(0x34 != varY8) is false, the code drops through to the 
	BRA next instruction.
	<li>The done label and the NOP are just placed there to give
	the target of the BRA branch somewhere to go to.  In a real 
	program the label "done" and the NOP instruction would be placed
	the the label of the code block that follows the if/then.
</ul>


<pre>
	LDAA	#25
	CMPA	varX8
	BLO	ifBody

	LDAA	#$34
	CMPA	varY8
	BNE	ifBody

then:	BRA	next

ifBody:	LDAA	#$11
	STAA	varZ8

next:	NOP
</pre>


<h2>Case Switch</h2>
Among all the C statements to implement, the case/switch is pretty
straight forward because the logic checks for equality between the 
variable in the switch and each of the cases.  Lets take the
following C-code:

<pre>
   switch(char) {
     case 'X':
         register B = 0xAA;
         break
     case 'Y':
         register B = 0xBB;
         break
     default:
         register B = 0x00;
         break;
   }
</pre>

The assembly code uses a new constant base, ASCII.  In order to 
spcify an ASCII constant, just surround the ASCII character with
single quotes.

<pre>
Switch:     LDAA    #'Y'
            STAA    Char
            
CaseX:      CMPA    #'X'
            BNE     CaseY
            LDAB    #$AA         
            BRA     EndSwitch           

CaseY:      CMPA    #'Y'
            BNE     Default
            LDAB    #$BB         
            BRA     EndSwitch
            
Default:    LDAB    #$00         
            BRA     EndSwitch            


EndSwitch:

</pre>

<!--  This is an HTML comment -->

<li>Write assembly code to perform the following:
<pre>
if (varX8 <= varY8 + 5) {
	varZ8 = 0
} else {
	varZ8 = 1;
} // end if
</pre>


<!---
The solution requires that we flip the order of the condition 
so that we perform the addition first and store the sum into an
accumulator to comapre against varX8.  In other words we will
write the assembly code for the following equivlent C code.
<pre>
if (varY8 + 5 >= varX8) {
	varZ8 = 0
} else {
	varZ8 = 1;
} // end if
</pre>

<pre>
	LDAA	#5
	ADDA	varY8		; A <- M[varY8] + 5
	CMPA	varX8
	BHS	clrZ8		; if (var8 <= varY + 5) varZ8 = 1;
setZ8:	CLR	varZ8
	INC	varZ8
	BRA	next
clrZ8:	CLR	varZ8

next:
</pre>
-->

<li>Write assembly code to perform the following:
<pre>
	if ((varX8 >= 25) && (varY8 == 0x34)) 
		varZ8 = 0x11;
	else
		varZ8 = 0x22;
</pre>

<!--
The trick in this solution is that I inverted the condition
"varX8 >= 25" to "varX8 < 25" because I want to jump to the
then clause when "varX8 < 25" is true because the first condition
cannot be TRUE when one of the clauses is FALSE.  Hence, in my
solution you will see the term BHI to check when the test 
"25 > varX8" is true then we immediatly know to assign varZ8 the value
0x22 without having to check if varY8 equals 0x34.   This technique
of only evaluating as much of a complex condition as needed is called
<u>short-circuit evaluation</u>.
