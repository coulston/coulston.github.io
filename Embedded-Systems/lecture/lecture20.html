<h2>PIC ADC interface</h2>
If you are using the ADC subsystem of the PIC you will need to feed
your analog signals into one of the ANx pins.  Inside the ADC the
successive approximation register (SAR) performs the actual conversion 
of the analog value into the converted value.  Like many other 
microcontrollers, the PIC has a single 10-bit SAR, so there 
is a analog mux on the front-end of the SAR to select one of the analog
signal to quantize.  When I say <u>10-bit SAR</u>, I am telling you how 
many bits the SAR uses to quantize the analog input.  10-bit outputs
from the SAR are stored in a pair of 8-bit registers, ADRESH:ADRESL
The 10-bit value can be either left or right justifies inside the
16 available bits.  We will typically left justify the ADC result so
that we can access the 8 most significant bits by reading ADRESH; we
will just ignore the least significant 2-bits in ADRESL.
<br><Br>

Every ADC conversion starts by the user program setting the 
ADCON0bits.GO_nDONE bit.  This bit will stay at logic 1 until the
conversion is complete when the bit will be cleared.  Putting 
together these concepts yields the following code snippet that
will convert 
<pre>
	ADCON0bits.GO_nDONE = 1;
	while (ADCON0bits.GO_nDONE == 1);
	x = ADRESH;
</pre>

<h3>Clock Jitter</h3>
A common application for analog to digital converters is to sample
a signal and store the digitized signal for further analysis or
reproduction through a digital to analog converter.  In order to 
do this, the input waveform is sampled at some period rate called
the sampling rate.  In an ideal world, the input signal would be
sampled at exactly the sampling rate, but in the real world there
will be some clock jitter - small variations in the sampling rate.
Clock jitter creates noise in the quantized amplitude of the input
waveform.<br><br>

In the figure below left, two input waveforms (blue at 10MHz and 
green at 110MHz) are being sampled at 100Mhz (referenced by the
black clock signal).  The figure below right shows when these two
input waveforms are sampled when there is variation/jitter in the 
rising edge of the sampling clock.   Now there is an interval of time
when the input waveforms could be converted, resulting in different
converted values.  The range of potential converted values is larger
for the higher frequency waveform.

The upshot of this is that if we are sampling a signal, then we 
need to carefully consider the stability of our sampling rate
a a part of our noise analysis.  We will dive into the topic of
noise.

<ul>
<li>A 10MHz 2v (peak to peak) sinusoidal input is applied to a 16-bit
ADC that is sampling the input signal at 100MHz.  What is the largest change
in the input between consecutive samples?  In other words, how much 
does this input voltage change between two samples correspond to change 
in the 16-bit output between those two input if the ADC is referenced 
to 3.3v and GND.

<!--
Assuming the sine wave is centered at 0v, has frequency 10MHz and an
amplitude of +1v/-1v, the equation of the input waveform is given by:<br><br>

v(t) = sin(2*&pi;*10<sup>7</sup>*t)<br><br>

A 0v centered sine wave has the highest slope when it crosses 0V - see
the blue waveform in the leftmost panel (Figure 1) in the Clock Jitter.
The time difference between consectutive samples, when a signal is 
sampled at 100MHz, is 1/100MHz = 10ns.  According to the sloped 
argument, the maximum change in the input will occur when we sample
at -5ns and then sample at 5ns.<br><br>

From the equation of the input signal we have:
<pre>
v(5ns)  = sin(2*&pi;*10<sup>7</sup>*5ns) = sin(2*&pi;*5*10<sup>-2</sup>) = 0.31
v(-5ns) = sin(2*&pi;*10<sup>7</sup>*-5ns) = sin(2*&pi;*-5*10<sup>-2</sup>) = -0.31

v(5ns) - v(-5ns) = 0.31v - (-0.31v) = 0.62V
</pre>
Thus, the largest change in the sampled input voltages is 0.62v.  
Converting this change of input voltages to digital outputs is
straightforward using the ratiometric relationship.

<pre>
	3.3v   0.62V
        ---- = ----		x = 12,313
        2<sup>16</sup>     x
</pre>

-->

<li>Clock jitter causes deviations in the sampling clock rate. 
If our sampling clock deviated by &pm;10ps, how much difference
could this make to the input values of a 10MHz 2v (peak to peak) 
sinusoidal input sampled at 100MHz.  How much could the jitter
effect the converted output from the ADC for a single sample?

<!--
The input signal is described by the equation:<br>
v(t) = sin(2*&pi;*10<sup>7</sup>*t)<br><br>

From the preceeding problem, the maximum chage of the sinusoidal
input signal will be when the signal crosses 0.  Since v(0) = 0,
then we need to know what the jittered voltage v(10ps) equals
using the equation for the signal.  This will give us the maximum
difference the jitter can effect the input voltage.

<pre>
v(-5<sup>-11</sup>) = sin(2*&pi;*-5*10<sup>-4</sup>*t) = -314uV
v(5<sup>-11</sup>) = sin(2*&pi;*5*10<sup>-4</sup>*t) = 314uV

v(5ps) - v(-5ps) = 314V - (-314V) = 628uV

Now convert this voltage to ADC count output:

	3.3v   628uV
        ---- = ----		x = 12
        2<sup>16</sup>     x
</pre>
This means that you could see upwards of 12 counts of error on the 
ADC output due to the jitter.
