<h1>Interrupts</h1>
Last class we went over the big picture of interrupts and how to
write a program to generate a waveform using a timer 0 interrupt.
Some lessons that we learned...

<ul>
	<li>An interrupt service routine (ISR) is a function that is 
		called by hardware.
	<li>ISR has no input parameters and does not return a value.
	<li>In our development environment you will declare an ISR:
	<pre>void high_priority interrupt tmr0_isr(void)</pre>
	<li>The event that causes the hardware to call the ISR is called 
	an interrupt and generally corresponds to setting a hardware flag.
	<li>Before leaving the ISR you need to clear the hardware flag.
	<li>To generate a interrupt, you must set the interrupt enable bit
	for the hardware subsystem and set global interrupts by
	setting the INTCONbits.GIE bit.
	<li>ISRs use "static" variables to retain values between ISR 
		invocations.
	<li>ISR's use global variables to share values with main.
</ul>

<h2>Processor timeline with an active interrupt</h2>
Lets examine how the processor reacts when its running the program
given in the basicInterrupt.c program linked at the top of this
web page.

<h1>Example Interrupt Problem</h1>
The goal of this exercise is to write a program, consisting of an ISR and
main, that measure (an approximate) duration of a pulse on pin RA2 and light
an LED on pin RC0 is the pulse if 50ms or longer.  The image below shows
an example of csuch a pulse on RA2.  You program should store the duration 
of the pulse, in milliseconds, in a variable pulseLength.  Hence, if the
pulse was 123.4 ms, your program would assign the variable pulseLength 
the value 123.

<br><img src="./img/pulseLengthISR01.bmp"><br><br>

Your program will divide this task into two parts, the ISR will:
<ul>	<li>Use TMR0 to interrupt once every milliscond,
	<li>Holds the intermediate pulse duration in a local variable,
	<li>Write the pulse duration in a global variable,
	<li>On every rising edge of RA2, set a global flag true.
</ul> 

Main will
<ul>	<li>Wait for the flag indicating a new pulse,
	<li>If the pulse length is less than 50ms turn an LED on.
</ul>
	
I like to draw pictures of my algorithms to get a feel for how to structure
the code.  In the image below, at left, is a representation of the major
function (main and the ISR) and the variables (pulseLength, newPulse and 
pulseLengthSoFar) they exchange.  An arrow from a function to a variable
means that the function writes a value to the variable.  An arrow from
a variable to a function means that the function reads that variable.
At right in the image below is a revised figure of the logic pulse 
with a hatch drawn on the pin-logic-level line every one millisecond
when the ISR is called.  The falling and rising edges of the pulse are
annotated with the actions taken by the ISR.

<br><img src="./img/pulseLengthISR02.bmp"><br><br>

Now let's turn this into code.  The top of your program should contain
the global variables.  Their initial values are only that, first values.
These initial values can be overwritten and changed by your program.
<br><br>

Next, main.  This is pretty straightforward, just poll the newPulse
flag and then check if the pulse was 50ms or longer.
<br><br>

The ISR is really where the action happend.  The ISR looks first for a 
negative edge on pin RA2.  This is characterized by the previous value
of RA2 (on the last interrupt) being logic 1 and the current value of
RA2 (during this interrupt) being logic 0.  I set the pulseLengthSoFar
variable to 0 so that we can start counting the number of interrupt 
cycles that RA2 is logic 0, by incrementing the pulseLengthSoFar variable.
Since we need to maintain the value of this variable between ISR "calls",
the variable is typed "static", meaning its value does not go away 
when we leave the ISR, instead, the next time we enter the ISR, the
pulseLengthSoFar variable will have the value it had when we last left
the ISR (1ms ago).  Any initialization of a static variable pertains
to <u>just the first ISR invocation</u>.  The initialization statement
for a static variable is not used on any subsequent ISR invocation.
<br><Br>

Likewise, the prevRA2 variable needs the value
that we assigned it on the previous ISR call (1ms ago).  The currRA2
variable is set by reading PORTAbits.RA2, the logic level on pin RA2.
One of the last things that we do in the ISR is to assign the 
prevRA2 variable the value stores in currRA2.  This is because when 
we leave to the ISR, we will return in 1ms.  In the future, what we 
consider to be the current value of RA2  will be the previous value
of RA2.
<br><Br>

When the ISR detects a positive edge on the RA2 pin, it writes the
pair of global variables.  The final else condition is only 
executed when the currRA2 == prevRA2 == 0.  In this case, the pulse
is at logic 0.  Consequently, we increment the pulseLengthSoFar variable
to indicate that the RA2 pin has spent yet another millisecond at logic
0.



<pre>

// Global variables
uint8_t pulseLength = 0;
uint8_t newPulse = false;

void main(void) {
    INIT_PIC();

    for (;;) {
	while (newPulse == false);
	newPulse = false;
	if (pulseLength > 50) LATCbits.LATC0 = LED_ON;
}   }


void ISR(void) {
    static uint8_t pulseLengthSoFar = 0;
    static uint8_t prevRA2 = 1;
    uint8_t currRA2;

    currRA2 = PORTAbits.RA2;

    if ( (prevRA2 == 1) && (currRA2 == 0) ) {		// negative edge
	pulseLengthSoFar = 0;
    } else if ( (prevRA2 == 0) && (currRA2 == 1) ) {	// positive edge
	pulseLength = pulseLengthSoFar;
	newPulse = true;
    } else if (currRA2 == 0) {				// pulse is low
	pulseLengthSoFar += 1;
    }

    prevRA2 = currRA2;		// current value is previous value 1ms from now
    INTCONbits.TMR0IF = 0;	// clear flag for next interrupt
    TMR0 = 0x1000 - 1000;	// 1,000 counts at 1:16 presaler = 1ms
}
</pre>

<ol>

<li>Modify  <a href="./code/basicInterrupt.c">basicInterupt.c</a>
to look at the active high button connected to RA2 every 10 ms
and generate a 0.25 second long pulse if the button is pressed.

<li>Modify  <a href="./code/basicInterrupt.c">basicInterupt.c</a>
to debounce the active high button attached to RA0.  
<a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/287">
Switch bouncing</a> occurs because mechanical switches have
mechanical contacts that literally bounce when making or breaking
contact. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xadoeJEhTJU">Here</a>
is a good video showing the output of a switch that exhibits switch
bouncing.

In order to debounce a switch, I want you to sample the switch you
value every 10 ms.  Based on the sampled values, you should update
a global variable <i>cleanButton</i>.  You should only change the
value of cleanButton when there is overwhelming evidence that it
is the wrong value.  Overwhelming evidence is the presence of 8
consecutive samples of the button which disagree with the value
in cleanButton.

In order to generate a 10 ms delay the timer needs to be set to
a 4:1 prescaler.

<pre>
     1 second      1000 ms    4 clk     x counts      10 ms
    ------------ * -------- * ------- * ---------- = -------- 
    16*10^6 clks   1 second   1 count   1 ISR call   ISR call

    x = 40,000 counts
</pre>

The idea behind the program is pretty simple, collect a new sample of 
RA0 every 10 ms in the ISR by shifting the newest RA0 into the LSB of
an 8-bit shift register.  When the shift register contains all 1's,
this means that the last 8 samples all have been 1's and the global
variable cleanButton should be set to 1.  Likewise when the shift 
regsiter contains all 0's, the global variable cleanButton should be
cleared to 0.

//*****************************************************************
//*****************************************************************
#define TEN_MILLI 40000
void high_priority interrupt tmr0_isr(void) {

    static int8 shiftRegister = 0x00;
    shiftRegister = (shiftRegister << 1) | PORTAbits.RA0;
    if (shiftRegister == 0xFF)	cleanButton = 1;
    if (shiftRegister == 0x00)	cleanButton = 0;

    TMR0 = TMR0 + TEN_MILL;
    INTCONbits.TMR0IF=0; 

} // end tmr0_isr

<li>Create an ISR on compare channel 0 that is called every 10ms.
If the ISR detects that an active high button on RA1 is being
pressed, generate a 1 second long pulse on RA2.  While generating
the 1 second pulse, your ISR should not be using all the CPU
cycles.

In order to generate a 10 ms delay the timer needs to be set to
a 4:1 prescaler.

To generate the one second pulse, I will have the RA2 pin set
high for 100 10 millisecond calls of the ISR.

//*****************************************************************

void high_priority interrupt tmr0_isr(void) {

    static int8 tenMilliSecondCount = 0;
    static int8 generatingOneSecondPulse = FALSE;

    if (generatingOneSecondPulse == TRUE) {
	tenMilliSecondCount += 1;
	if (tenMilliSecondCount == 100) {
	    LATAbits.LATA2 = 0;
	    generatingOneSecondPulse = FALSE;
    }	}
	
    if ((PORTAbits.RA1 == 1) && (generatingOneSecondPulse == FALSE)) {
	generatingOneSecondPulse = TRUE;
	tenMilliSecondCount = 0;
	LATAbits.LATA2 = 1;
    }

    TMR0 = TMR0 + TEN_MILLI;   // Set the delay until the next interrupt
    INTCONbits.TMR0IF=0; 
    
} // end timer 0 interrupt
