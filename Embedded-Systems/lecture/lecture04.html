<h1>C looping statements</h1>
Loops repeat the execution of a collection of statements (called the body) 
until some condition is met.  Today we will examine two of the more useful
looping structures in C, the for and while loops.


<h2>For-loops</h2>
A for-loop generally is used when you need a counting variable along with
iteration.  The counting variable is often referred to as the loop variable.
The for statement itself has three components separated by 
semicolons as shown in the following figure and a body.<Br><br>
<br><img src="./img/forStruc.bmp"><br><br>

<ul><li>The initalization statement is executed only once, when 
	the for-loop is first entered.  Embedded programmers do not 
	typically declare the data-type of the loop-variable in this 
	statement (even though you may have done this in a previous 
	programming class).  The variable that is initialized is
	usually the variable the controls the number of times that
	the body of the for loop is executed.  Hence, thgis variable
	is refered to as the loop control variable.
	<li>The condition is checked <u>before</u> the body of the 
	loop is executed.  If the condition is true, the body is 
	executed, otherwise the loop is terminated.  Remember that
	TRUE is the equivlent of any non-zero value
	<li>The increment statement is executed at the end of the loop,
	<u>after</u> the body has been executed.  The increment statement
	typically changes the loop control variable.  The term
	"increment" is used here loosely because you can perform any
	sort of operation in this field.  For example you could have
	a for loop that initializes the loop control variable to 10 and
	the "increment" statement could decrement the loop control 
	variable.  Other mathematical operations can be used as needed.
	<li>The body is typically the whole point of having a for loop,
	it's the stuff that you want to do.
</ul>

The flow-chart to the right of the for-loop shown in the figure above
describes the relationship between these four statements graphically.
Hopefully you can put together these pieces to figure out that the 
for-loop given at left in the figure above executes the body 10 times.
<br><Br>

Let's explore the operation of another for-loop with the following example.

<pre>
    uint8_t i;
    uint8_t sum = 0;
    uint16_t prod = 1;

    for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
	sum += i;
	if (i>0) prod *= i;
	// now record value of i, sum and prod in the table
    } // end for
</pre>

Fill in the following table with the values of the three values
at the line indicated in the program above.  Make sure to respect
the data type!
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>i	<td>sum		<td>prod
<tr><td>0	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>1	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>2	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>3	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>4	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>5	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>6	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>7	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>8	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>9	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
</table>

<!--

If your for-loop is acting strangely, make sure that you have not
inadvertently done something to the loop variable in the body
of your for-loop.  A C compiler would have no problem with allowing
you to decrement the i variable (subtracting 1 from it) in the 
body of the for-loop above.<br><br>

<h3>Count down loops</h3>
There will be times when you need a index variable that goes from
a large value to a small value.  This is especially common when
working with arrays.  Let's look at an example program to see
how to make a for-loop count down.
<br><br>

The for loop i the following code snippet initialize the loop 
counting variable i to 10.  The comparision will stop the for-loop 
iterating when the index variable i equals 0.  The trick to making 
the count down work is the decrement operation i--.  This operator
decrements i, subtracts 1, on every iteration of the loop.  So,
what would the value of sum equal to after the execution of the
following code snippet?<br>
sum = 10 + 9 + &hellip; 1 = 55.

<pre>
    uint8_t i;
    uint8_t sum;

    for (i=10; i>0; i--) {
        sum += i;
    } // end for
</pre>






<h3>Infinite loops and the superloop</h3>
Before we leave this section there is one very special for-loop that
I would like to present before we leave.

<pre>
    for(;;) {
	body;
    }    
</pre>

This for-loop has no initialization, condition or increment statements.
The most important in this case is that
it lacks a condition.  When left blank, the condition field is 
assumed to be TRUE.  Hence, this for-loop never terminates.
This is an <u>infinite loop</u>, meaning that once execution enters 
this for-loop, the program will forever execute the body.  In your
previous programming courses, you probably would avoid
a structure like this because you would want your program to end so 
that the computer could do other things.  Well in our environment,
our computer is embedded into an application and has nothing else to
do expect the application we are designing it into. For example, imagine
if a vending machine with an embedded processor reached the end of
its program and then just stopped running!  This would not be acceptable,
so we design the main program as an infinite loop, checking for money,
dispensing beverages and then going back to check for money.
<br><br>

The vending machine is a good example of the structure that we will
use for most of our programs this term, the super-loop.  A super-loop
is an infinite loop that contains a set of tasks that are performed
over and over again.  For eample

<pre>
    for(;;) {
	if (current_temperature > highSetPoint) {
	    TURN_ON_COMPRESSOR();
	}

	if (current_temperature < lowSetPoint) {
	    TURN_OFF_COMPRESSOR();
	}

	if (coinDeposit == TRUE) {
	    switch(grade) {
		case NICKLE:
		    total += 5;
		    break;
		case DIME:
		    total += 10;
		    break;
		case QUARTER:
		    total += 25;
		    break;
	    } // end switch
	    coinDeposit = FALSE;
	}

	if (total >= 100) {
	    DISPENSE_SODA();
	    total = 0;
	}

    } // end super-loop
</pre>

It's pretty easy to read through this list of tasks and figure out
what the vending machine is doing.  In the case of a super-loop you
are expecting that the loop is executed quickly enough that the user
will sense that the machine acts instantously to any input, when in fact
we know that the machine is doing one thing at a time.
<br><br>

Later in the semester, we will add interrupts to the super-loop
software architecture so that the microcontoller can really do several
things at the same time.


<h2>While loops</h2>
While loops are structurally more simple than for-loop, having a 
single condition, that while true, allows the body of the while-loop
to execute.  So, for example, the following while loop produces the
same iterative behavior as the first for-loop.

<pre>
    uint8_t i;
    uint8_t sum = 0;
    uint16_t prod = 1;

    i = 0;
    while(i < 10) {
	sum += i;
	if (i > 0) prod *= i;
	i += 1;
    }
</pre>

However, a while-loop like this is of little practical use because this
loop structure is more naturally realized using a for-loop.  However,
there is one very important use of while-loop that we will use extensively
and that is to wait for some external event to happen.<br><br>

<h2>Delay loops</h2>
A delay loop is a loop constructed to have the embedded processor wait
for some event.  Lets look at a concrete example that we will work with
in lab 2, controlling an LED with a push button.  To accomplish this task
we will need to make some assumption here that will be justified later on.
<br>
First, we will connect our push button to our PIC and that associated 
with this push button we have a variable called "buttonPressed".  This 
variable is TRUE when the user presses on the push button and FALSE when 
the user is not pressing the button.  <br>
Second, we will connect an LED to out PIC and that associated with
the LED is a variable called "LED".  Assigning this variable the value of
0 will turn the LED off, assigning a 1 will turn the LED on.<br>
Finally, we need to recognize that <u>the microcontroller is executing the
instructions many millions of times faster than a user can press or 
release the button.</u>  With these assumptions in place lets look at a
practical delay loop that you will see many times in our course.
<br><br>

<pre>
1.    LED = 0;				// turn off the LED
2.    for(;;) {
3.    	while(buttonPressed == FALSE);	// wait for a button press
4.    	while(buttonPressed == TRUE);	// wait for a button release
5.	LED ^= 1;			// toggle the LED
6.    }
</pre><br><br>

Let's walk through the program from top to bottom.  To facilitate this
discussion, I have added line numbers in the far left; please understand
that these are not actually part of the program.<br>

<b>Line 1</b> turns the LED off.  While not strictly part of the problem 
statement, its often a good idea to put indicators like LEDs into a 
know initial state at the start of a program.<br>

<b>Lines 2-6</b> form an infinite loop.  Meaning that our computer will forever
be checking the state of the button and turning the LED on and off.<br>

<b>Line 3</b> is a while-loop that executes its (empty) body while the button
is not pressed.  There are two important points to make here.  First,
<u>this while loop may get stuck executing this while loop many millions
of times before the button is pressed.</u>   This is because the PIC
is running at 64 MHz, meaning that its executing 64 million (assembly)
instructions per second.  Hence, it can do a lot of checks every second.
Second, while our program is executing this while loop <u>it is doing
absolutely nothing except checking that button.</u>  This is the 
quintessential delay loop, synchronizing the execution of our program 
to the user's input by waiting and doing nothing until the user performs
some task.  You rarely see these types of statements in other programming
classes because variables in those classes only change under your programs
control, but in this class we will have variables that change based on
actions performed outside your program.<br>

<b>Line 4</b> is a while-loop that executes its (empty) body while the button
is pressed. Once again, the PIC is executing statements millions of times
faster than the user can release the button.  Hence, our program needs to
wait until the button has been released before continuing.<br>

<b>Line 5</b> toggle the state of the LED after the button has been pressed
and then released.

<ol>
<li>Write a for loop that starts at 3, counts up by 5 and ends before
reaching 105.
<!--
<pre>
    uint8_t i;
    for (i=3; i<105; i+=5) {
	body;

<li>Write a loop that counts up by one while a button is being held down.
Since the while-loop would be executing so much faster than the user
could respond this would make a reasonablly good random number generator.
The counter should be type uint8_t.  I would expect that this counter variable
would roll-over many, many times while the button is pressed.  This is
not a problem as again, we are expect to end up with a random number.

<pre>
    uint8_t count = 0;

    while(buttonPressed == TRUE) count += 1;

<li> A linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is a general techanique
 that has been used with great success in generating pseudo-random number. 
A pseudo-random number is a number that looks random to someone who 
does not know how they are produced, but is in fact generated by a 
deterministic procedure (an algorithm).
<br><br>

A pseudo-random number generator starts with a seed valuye (any non-zero 
number) and generates a sequence of numbers that look like they have no 
relationship to one another. To generate a sequence of pseudo-random 
16-bit numbers using an LFSR with current varX16. To do this:
<ul>
<li>Step 1: xor the bits in positions 15,13,12,10 and 0 (start 
	indexing your bits starting at position 0),
<li>Step 2: shift varX16 left one bit,
<li>Step 3: put the xor bit into the LSB of varX16.
</ul>

Write a program to generate pseudo-random numbers using a LFSR.


<!--

This program will really stretch your coding skills and make you
practice all the concepts we have learned.  I structured my program
as an infinte loop that computes new values of the pseudo-random number
varX16 on each iteration.  The first thing that I do in the loop is
isolate bits 15,13,12,10 and 0, each in its own variable.   This 
requires some explaining which I will use the 13th bit as an example.
<br><br>

I get the value of the 13th bit of varX16 by first building a mask, a
bit pattern that will allow the 13th bit of varX16 to be isolated.  The
mask, in this case, is 1 shifted left 13-bits (this is the expression
"1 << 13") which has a binary value 
of 0010 0000 0000 0000.  I will call this binary pattern "mask" in the
following discussion.  Since this mask has 0's everywhere except the 13th 
position, "mask AND varX16" will definitly have 0's in every bit position 
outside the 13th bit position.  Note "AND" is being played by "&" in the 
C-code.
In the 13th bit position of "mask AND varX16", the 1 in the mask will allow
the 13t bit of varX16 to show through (because 1 and x = x).  Hence, if
varX16 AND mask is not zero (TRUE) then the 13th bit of varX16 must be 1
else the 13th position of varX16 must be 0.  I assign the variable x13
to be this 0 or 1 value.
<br><Br>

A similar argument is made for the other bits of varX16.  After these 5
bits have been determined they are XORed together using the "^" XOR 
operator into a new variable called newBit.  I made newBit a 16-bit type
because in the last line, I OR together (using the "|" operator) the
varX16 and newBit to form the next random value.
<br><Br>

The code is as follows:

<pre>
    uint16_t    varX16, newBit;
    uint8_t     x15, x13, x12, x10, x0;
    varX16 = 1;
    for(;;) {
        if (varX16 & (1 << 15)) x15=1; else x15=0;
        if (varX16 & (1 << 13)) x13=1; else x13=0;
        if (varX16 & (1 << 12)) x12=1; else x12=0;
        if (varX16 & (1 << 10)) x10=1; else x10=0;
        if (varX16 & (1 << 0))  x0=1;  else x0=0;
        newBit = x15 ^ x13 ^ x12 ^ x10 ^ x0;
        varX16 = (varX16 << 1) | newBit;
    }
</pre>

While the first 10-20 iterations of this algorithm are not very 
interesting, things quickly change and the sequence becomes 
increasingly difficult to predict.  Try it yourself, this makes
a great random even generator in games, something you might want
to build as part of your final project.

<li>Embedded C programs will let you get away with some pretty
weird stuff.  Sometimes this is really helpful, but when you are
starting out, this will allow you to make some pretty horrible
mistakes.  The following program will run and terminate.  What 
value will the count variable have when it does and explain how
it got that way.
<pre>
    uint8_t i, count = 0;
    for(i=200; i&gt;100; i++) {
	count += 1;
    }
</pre>

<!--
Since the i variable is typed as an 8-bit integer, it can only
have values between 0 and 255.  Furthermore, the i variable is
being incremented by 1 on every loop.  So, the i variable will
count up from 200 to 255 (this is 56 loop iterations) because 
the continuing condition i&gt;100 is true. However, when the 
i variable equals 255 and is incremented, then its value will go 
to 0.  This will cause the continuing condition to be false;
Hence the count variable will equal 56 at the end of the loop.
<br><br>

Note, the compiler will not throw any wanrnings or errors when
it sees this code.
--->

<li>Here is another weird one.  What does count equal when the
loop terminates?
<pre>
    uint8_t i, count = 0;
    for(i=200; i != 100; i++) {
	count += 1;
    }
</pre>

<!--
Using the same principle as the previous problem, the i variable will
be incremented from 200 up to 255 (56 iterations), then from 0 
and upwards to 99 (100 iterations).  On the last increment from 99 to 100,
the bosy of the for-loop is not incremented.  Hence count will equal
156.
--->



<li>Here is another weird one.  Does the loop terminate and if so,
what does count equal when it does?
<pre>
    uint8_t i, count = 0;
    for(i=200; i &lt;= 300; i++) {
	count += 1;
    }
</pre>

<!--
The big stand-out issue with this program is that 300 cannot be 
represented in 8-bits and the i variable is an 8-bit type.
So this problem is asking you to reflect on how the compiler handles 
the conditional statement "i &lt; 300".  Your first instinct would
be that the compiler would halt and throw an error on this statement.
Try it, it compiles only with an easy to ignore warning.
<br><br>

My initial suspecion was that the loop would terminate when i = 44
because the 8-bit representation of 300 is 44 when cast as an 8-bit
unsigned integer. However, this is not the case.
<br><br>

The code given causes the PIC to enter an infinite loop.
<br><br>

However, it does not do this without telling you something
is amiss.  The compiler provides the following warning telling you 
<pre>
arithmetic.c:42: warning: (764) mismatched comparison
arithmetic.c:42: warning: (757) constant conditional branch
</pre>

Where line 42 of the program contains the comparision "i &lt;= 300;"
-->

<li>Here is an interesting loop.  What does count equal when the loop
terminates?
<pre>
    uint8_t i, count = 0;
    for(i=43; i != 171; i*=3) {
        count += 1;
    }
</pre>

<!--
This problem is a beast, and to be honest, I would just drop it in
a compiler and see when (or if) it terminates.  However, we should
math it out to understand what is going on.
<br><br>

Every time the loop executes, i is multiplied by 3 and only the least 
8-bits are kept (because i has type uint8_t). Keeping the least 
significant 8-bits is eqivlent to a modulus operation.  I created a
excel speadsheet to compute successive values of i
i using the equation "=MOD(B3*3,256)" for the value of i in cell B4
where B3 contained the previous value of i (or 43 for the first value 
of i).  This gave me the following list:
<pre>
count	i
0	43
1	129
2	131
3	137
4	155
5	209
6	115
7	89
8	11
9	33
10	99
11	41
12	123
13	113
14	83
15	249
16	235
17	193
18	67
19	201
20	91
21	17
22	51
23	153
24	203
25	97
26	35
27	105
28	59
29	177
30	19
31	57
32	171
</pre>

So count = 32.  This problem is similar to The Chinese Remainder 
Theorem, an important problem in moder cryptography.  Look it up,
its cool stuff.
