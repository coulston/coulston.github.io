<li>A 10MHz 2v (peak to peak) sinusoidal input is applied to a 16-bit
ADC that is sampling the input signal at 100MHz.  What is the largest change
in the input between consecutive samples?  In other words, how much 
does this input voltage change between two samples correspond to change 
in the 16-bit output between those two input if the ADC is referenced 
to 3.3v and GND.
<br><br>

<b>Solution</b><br>
Assuming the sine wave is centered at 0v, has frequency 10MHz and an
amplitude of +1v/-1v, the equation of the input waveform is given by:<br><br>

v(t) = sin(2*&pi;*10<sup>7</sup>*t)<br><br>

A 0v centered sine wave has the highest slope when it crosses 0V - see
the blue waveform in the leftmost panel (Figure 1) in the Clock Jitter.
The time difference between consectutive samples, when a signal is 
sampled at 100MHz, is 1/100MHz = 10ns.  According to the sloped 
argument, the maximum change in the input will occur when we sample
at -5ns and then sample at 5ns.<br><br>

From the equation of the input signal we have:
<pre>
v(5ns)  = sin(2*&pi;*10<sup>7</sup>*5ns) = sin(2*&pi;*5*10<sup>-2</sup>) = 0.31
v(-5ns) = sin(2*&pi;*10<sup>7</sup>*-5ns) = sin(2*&pi;*-5*10<sup>-2</sup>) = -0.31

v(5ns) - v(-5ns) = 0.31v - (-0.31v) = 0.62v
</pre>
Thus, the largest change in the sampled input voltages is 0.62v.  
Converting this change of input voltages to digital outputs is
straightforward using the ratiometric relationship.

<pre>
	3.3v   0.62v
        ---- = ----		x = 12,313
        2<sup>16</sup>     x
</pre>

<li>Clock jitter causes deviations in the sampling clock rate. 
If our sampling clock deviated by &pm;10ps, how much difference
could this make to the input values of a 10MHz 2v (peak to peak) 
sinusoidal input sampled at 100MHz.  How much could the jitter
effect the converted output from the ADC for a single sample?
<br><br>

<b>Solution</b><br>
The input signal is described by the equation:<br>
v(t) = sin(2*&pi;*10<sup>7</sup>*t)<br><br>

From the preceeding problem, the maximum chage of the sinusoidal
input signal will be when the signal crosses 0.  Since v(0) = 0,
then we need to know what the jittered voltage v(10ps) equals
using the equation for the signal.  This will give us the maximum
difference the jitter can effect the input voltage.

<pre>
v(10<sup>-11</sup>) = sin(2*&pi;*10<sup>-4</sup>*t) = 628uv

Now convert this voltage to ADC count output:

	3.3v   628uv
        ---- = ----		x = 12
        2<sup>16</sup>     x
</pre>
This means that you could see upwards of 12 counts of error on the 
ADC output due to the jitter.

<li>An ADC is sampling a signal at 50kHz.  List the
first 7 alias of 3.5kHz?
<br>

<b>Solutions</b><br>
<pre>
1st harmonic:          3.5kHz                  50kHz-3.5kHz =  46.5kHz
2nd harmonic:    50kHz+3.5kHz= 53.5kHz        100kHz-3.5kHz =  96.5kHz
3rd harmonic:   100kHz+3.5kHz=103.5kHz        150kHz-3.5kHz = 146.5kHz
4th harmonic:   150kHz+3.5kHz=153.5kHz        200kHz-3.5kHz = 196.5kHz
</pre>

<li>An ADC is sampling a signal at 50kHz, what frequencies will alias 
to 8kHz in the 42th harmonic?  
<br>

<b>Solutions</b><br>
<pre>
100th harmonic: 43*50kHz-5kHz    42*50kHz+5kHz
</pre>

<li>An ADC is sampling a signal at 100kHz, what 
frequency, closest to 1,380kHz, alias to 15kHZ?<br>
<b>Solutions</b><br>
<pre>
	Let's find the start of the harmonic that is closest to 1,380kHz.
	1,380kHz / 100kHz = 13.8
	100kHz * 14 = 1,400kHz is the closest start of a harmonic to 1,380kHz

	Subtracting 15kHZ from this frequency gives us an alias of 
	1,400kHz - 15kHz = 1.385kHz which is just 5kHz away from the 
	target frequency of 1,380kHz.

<li>If you input a 1v sin wave into a circuit

<li>You're sampling an analog signal at 48kHz. List all the frequencies 
in the first 3 harmonics that alias to  2kHz signals. 
<br>

<b>Solutions</b><br>
<pre>
1st harmonic:	2kHz			48khz-2khz = 46kHz
2st harmonic:	48khz+2kHz=50kHz	96khz-2khz = 94kHz
3st harmonic:	96khz+2kHz=98kHz	144khz-2khz = 142kHz
</pre>


<li>A first-order LPF has a cutoff frequency of 2kHz. Describe the 
attenuation of a 80kHz input signal in decibels and as a ratio of 
output voltage to input voltage. 
<br>

<b>Solutions</b><br>
Since a decade is a multiplicative factor of 10, we need to find how
may powers of 10 you have to multiply by in order to increase 2 to 80.
In other words…
<pre>
2*10^x = 80, solving for X yields
x = log_10(80/2) = 1.6
</pre>

So we know that a 80khz waveform is 1.6 decades above a 2khz waveform.
Since the LPF attenuates -20db/decade, the 80khz waveform will be attenuated
1.6*-20 = -32db  Decibels can be converted to the ratio of output/input
using its definition...
<pre>
-32db = 20db log_10(V_out/V_in)
V_out/Vin = 0.025 = 1/40
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Sampling frequency:<br>
Given:
<ul>	<li>Signal of interest is 0-2kHz
	<li>1st order filter
	<li>10-bit ADC
</ul>
What is the minimum sampling rate?
<br>
<b>Solution</b><br>

<pre>
The antialias filter needs to reduced the lowest frequency alias to 1/2 LSB of its full scale value in order to make it undetectable to the ADC.  In the case of a 10-bit ADC this means that the filter needs to reduce the first alias to 20*log(2<sup>-11</sup>) = -66bB.  Since the corner frequency of the LPF is set to 2kHz, the first alias must be reduced -66dB.  For a first order filter with a total attenuation of -20dB/decade this is:

	  -20dB        -66dB
	---------- = ---------
	1 decade     x decades

x = 3.3 decades above 2kHz.  Now we have:
	log<sub>10</sub> ((fs-2kHz)/2kHz) = 3.3
Solving yields fs = 3988kHz or about 4MHz.
</pre>

<li>You want to know how much bandwidth your sampling system can accommodate.
Your sampling system uses a16-bit ADC with a sampling frequency of 250kHz.
You are using a 4th order low pass filter.  What is the maximum frequency 
of the signal of interest?
<br>
<b>Solution</b><br>


<pre>
½ULP needs 20 log(2^-17) = -102dB of attenuation.
A fourth order LPF has a roll off of -80dB/decade.

-80dB         -102dB
--------- =  --------- 	x = 1.275 decades
1 decade     x decades

The sampling frequency is 250kHz so now we have:
1.275 decades = log_10(250kHz – x / x)	or
18.8 = (250kHz – x)/x
19.8x = 250Khz
X = 12.6kHz

Thus our sampling system can handle signals from 0Hz–12.6kHz.
</pre>


<li>You are to design a sampling system using the following specifications. 
The signal of interest is from 0-2kHz, passes through a third order filter
and sampled at 48kHz. How many bits of accuracy can you expect from the ADC?
<br>
<b>Solution</b><br>

<pre>
Determine the range of frequencies:	log(46/2) = 1.36 decades
A third order LPF has a roll off of -60dB/decade.

-60dB           x dB
--------- =  ------------ 	x = -81.6dB
1 decade     1.36 decades

An important point to note is that this is the attenuation to get 
noise below ½ULP.  

-81.6dB = 20*log(V_o/V_i)	thus 
V_o / V_i = 83*10^-6		
Let V_i = 1v to normalize input. Then in order to represent V_o = 83*10^-6 
we need log_2(83*10-6) = -13.55 bits.  This is ½ULP of our ADC.  Thus our 
ADC needs -12.55 bit.  Since we do not have fractional bits and since we 
want meaningful information out of the ADC, we can only expect 12-bits of 
accuracy out of our ADC.
</pre>

<li>You are to design a low pass filter using the following specifications.  
The signal of interest is from 0-2kHz and sampled using an 8-bit ADC.  The 
sampling rate of your system is 48kHz.  What order filter do you need for 
this application? 
<br>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<pre>
Determine the amount of attenuation:	20 log(2^-9) = -54dB
Determine the range of frequencies:	log(46/2) = 1.36 decades

-20dB * x      -54 dB
--------- =  ------------ 	x = 1.98
1 decade     1.36 decades

Thus we need a second order filer

<br><b>Solution</b><br>
Since we have 5 fractional bits we will multiply and divide by 
2<sup>5</sup> = 32.  3.6 * 32 = 115.2 which rounds to 115. 
115 in decimal is equivlent to 01110011 in binary. Dividing
01110011 by 32 yields 011.10011.  Represented as a 3.5 format
number 3.6 is 01110011

<li>Interpret 01001101 as a  4.4 format number.

The fractional portion is 2<sup>-1</sup> + 2<sup>-2</sup> + 2<sup>-4</sup>

calculate the error of this representation.

<li>Your engineering design team has tasked you with developing the DDS engine
for a microcontroller platform that will be deployed in a radar application.
The N-bit output of the DDS engine is sent to a N-bit DAC which converts
this input into an output between 0v - 1v.  This application requires
the DDS to generate a sinusoid over a broad range of frequencies that
can be finely-adjusted.  Your team has decided on a microcontroller
family having 3 different models with 8kB, 32kB and 128kB of RAM with
a commensurate increasing unit cost.  The design of the DDS engine will
play an important role in determining the memory footprint in the RAM
and consequently which model to choose.  Your technical lead needs you
to provide the following.

<ol>
<li>Investigate the trade-off between the length of the DDS lookup table
(number of rows in the RAM) and the minimum step size on the output
of the DAC (measured in volts).  To do this make a table (in excel)
with two columns, number of rows in the RAM (between 2^4 and 2^16) and
step size (in volts).  Remember that the maximum slope of a sinusoid is 1. 
 
<li>Assume that you are working with a 16-bit word using a w.f formatted
fixed point number.  Investigate the trade-off between the number of
whole number bits and fractional bits and the frequency resolution of
the DDS subsystem.  Since you are working with a 16-bit word, w + f = 16.

<li>Use the 9-entry LUT from the previous problem in a new SQRT function.
The input to this function is an unsigned 8-bit integer in the range 
[0-15].  The output is a fixed point 2.6 format number.


<br><b>Solution</b><br><br>
uint8_t SQRT(uint8_t x) {

    uint8_t lut[9] = {0x00, 0x5B, 0x80, 0x9D, 0xB5, 0xCA, 0xDE, 0xEF, 0xFF};
    uint8_t index, delta, frac;

    index = x >> 1; 
    delta = lut[index+1] - lut[index];
    frac = x & 0b00000001;
    return(lut[index] + (frac*delta)>>1;
} // end SQRT
