<h1>Timer prescaler</h1>
The PIC has 7 total timers that all operate on the same principles as
timer 0.  The "even" timers, TMR2, TMR4, TMR6 are 8-bits wide, meaning that
they count-up from 0 to 255 and then roll-over.  All the timers have different
prescalers which we will learn more about in this lecture.
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Timer	<td>Width	<td>Prescaler		<td>Associate module
<tr><td>TMR0	<td>8 or 16-bit	<td>1:1 to 1:256	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>TMR1	<td>16-bit	<td>1:1, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16	<td>Capture Compare

In the previous lecture we noted that counting from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>
the PIC's 16-bit counter took 4.096 ms.  With this timer configuration
there is no other way to use the timer, by itself, to form longer delays.
In order to generate longer delays we would either need to slow down the
frequency of the main oscillator F<sub>osc</sub> or slow down the counting
rate of the clock. The PIC, like many other microcontrollers, has a build-in
mechanism to slow down the count rate of timer; prescalers.  

<h2>Prescaler</h2>
A prescaler is a piece of logic that sits between the bus clock
and the timer clock.  

<br><img src="./img/simpleTimer.jpg"><br>
The timer subsystem, adapted from Figure 11-1 on page 155 of the
<u>PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet</u>.
<br><Br>

The prescaler accumulates a prescribed number of
bus clocks before issuing a clock tick to the timer.  In order to use
the prescaler, the prescaler assignment bit in the 
<font face="courier" color=red>T0CON</font> must be cleared.  In other
words, if you want to use a prescaler to slow down the counting rate if
<font face="courier" color=red>TMR0</font>, then the following line of
code or its equivlent must appear in your code.
<font face="courier" color=red>T0CONbits.PSA=0;</font>
<br><br>


The value of the prescaler is contained inside the Timer 0 Control register 
<font face="courier" color=red>T0CON</font> in your code. Three
bits in this register, <font face="courier">T0PS2, T0PS1, T0PS0</font>,
collectively referred to as <font face="courier">PR</font>, control
which prescaler is selected. The following table taken from page 154
of the <u>PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet</u> describes the relationship
between the prescaler bits and the prescaler applied to the bus clock 
before it's sent to the counter.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">

<b>Aside</b>
Let's take a moment to look at three different ways that we can 
assign the prescaler value to say 1:16.
<ul>	<li>	<font face="courier">T0CONbits.T0PS2 =0;</font><br>
		<font face="courier">T0CONbits.T0PS1 =1;</font><br>
		<font face="courier">T0CONbits.T0PS0 =1;</font>
	<li><font face="courier">T0CONbits.T0PS = 0b011;</font>
	<li><font face="courier">T0CON = 0b10000011;</font>
</ul>

The first form assigns each individual bit, requiring three lines of code.
The second form shows how you can collect all three prescaler configuration 
bits together and assign them at once.  This results in a single line of code,
note that the expression "0b" in front of the three bit value indicates
to the compiler that this is a binary number.
The third form takes the second idea one step further and assigns all 8 bits 
of the T0CON register at once.  Note that the expression "bits.FIELD" is 
removed from "T0CON" since we are talking about the entire register.  This
third form requires you to know the order and 
The thirs
it is possible to write mulitple bits of the 
<font face="courier" color=red>T0CON</font> register at once by dropping
the "bits.FIELD" from T0CON and using a line of code similar to
<font face="courier" color=red>T0CON = 0b01010101;</font>.  This requires
that you know the identity and values for the bit fields in the T0CON
register.  You would need to look at page 154 of the 
<u>PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet</u> to get this information.
<br><br>

To put this discussion in concrete terms, if you make the assignment 
<font face="courier">T0CONbits.T0PS = 0b011;</font> in your code, then
the 16-bit timer counter will count up once every 16 F<sub>osc</sub>/4 cycles.
In other words (see the work below) the counter will increment once every 
microsecond.
<br><br>



<pre>
     1 second      10^6 us    16 clk    1 us
    ------------ * -------- * ------- = -----
    16*10^6 clks   1 second   1 count   count
</pre>

I will sometimes use the expression 1:16 to describe when F<sub>osc</sub>
is being divided by 16.  I find it easy to visualize this
by thinking of the ' : ' as a ratio symbol that tells me how many
F<sub>osc</sub>/4 clock cycles it takes to increment the timer.

<h2>Time ranges</h2>
To see how a prescaler affects the upper-bound of the timer, let's 
revisit the following code-snippet from the last lecture.

<pre>
	T0CONbits.PSA = 0;	// Turn on prescaler
	T0CONbits.T0PS = 0b011;	// configure 1:16 prescaler
	T0CONbits.TMR0ON = 1;	// Turn on timer 0
	INTCONbits.T0IF = 0;	// Clear roll-over flag
	while(INTCONbits.T0IF == 0);	// Wait for roll-over flag to be set by counter
</pre>

Your question is to calculate how long (in milliseconds) the   
<font face="courier">while(INTCONbits.T0IF == 0);</font>  statement takes to 
execute, assuming that the counter starts at 0. In other words, I am 
asking how long it takes for the counter to roll-over.   You will 
need to use dimensional analysis to prove that your conversion is 
correct.  Like in the previous solutions, I would advise you to
start the problem with F<sub>osc</sub>/4, move through the
prescaler, and then onto the counter.


<pre>
     1 second      1000 ms    16 clk    2^16 counts 
    ------------ * -------- * ------- * ----------- 
    16*10^6 clks   1 second   1 count   1 roll-over 

which comes out to  65.5 ms
                   ---------
                   roll-over
</pre>
<br><Br>

When you solve these problems, it's important to verify that all the 
units, except those that you want, cancel.  We will call the time 
required for the counter to go from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup> - 1 and then back to 
0 the <u>maximum period</u> of the counter.  Practice using the dimensional
analysis technique to determine the maximum period (in milliseconds) for 
all the prescalers in the following table. The maximum periods for each
prescaler are shown in a previous table and rounded to 3 
significant figures.  You will need this table to solve practical problems
of interest like the following:<br>

<h3>Some problems</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Question:</b>How much time goes by in 30,00 counts with a 1:8
prescaler?  State your answer in ms and round to 3 significant figures.
<br>
<b>Answer:</b>

<pre>
      1 second     1000 ms    8 clk
    ------------ * -------- * ------- * 30,000 counts = 15ms
    16*10^6 clks   1 second   1 count
</pre>
<br>

<li><b>Question:</b>Starting at 30,000, how long will it take TMR0 to
roll-over with a 1:8 prescaler?
State your answer in ms and round to 3 significant figures.
<br>
<b>Answer:</b>
There are 2<sup>16</sup>-30,000=35,536 counts until TMR0 rolls-over.
<pre>
      1 second     1000 ms     8 clk    35,536 counts   17.8 ms
    ------------ * -------- * ------- * ------------- = ---------
    16*10^6 clks   1 second   1 count    roll over      roll over
</pre>
<br>

<li><b>Question:</b>What starting value would result in TMR0 rolling over
in 100ms?
<br>
<b>Answer:</b>
First, we need to select a prescaler for TMR0.  Always select the smallest
prescaler that has a Max Period greater or equal to the needed duration.
In the case of a 100ms delay, we need a 1:32 prescaler.  Next,
we will call the tarting value of the TMR0, x.  TRM0 has to count up
from x to 2<sup>16</sup> in order to roll-over.  This is a total of
2<sup>-x</sup>-x counts.  This term is used int he solution to the
problem.

<pre>
    16*10^6 clks   1 second   1 count    roll over
    ------------ * -------- * ------- * ---------- = 100 ms
      1 second     1000 ms    32 clk       2<sup>16</sup>-x

solving for x yields, x = 15,536
</pre>
<br>


<li><b>Question:</b>An active low push button is connection to RA2, is
pressed for an unknown amount of time - except that we know that it
is not more than 200ms. Complete the program below to measure the number
of TMR0 counts of the button press. 
<br><img src="./img/buttonPressTimer.bmp"><br><br>

<b>Answer:</b>
In our previous examples we assumed that the timer starts at 0.  In this 
example we will compute the difference between two timer count values.
In addition, we will assume that the push button starts in the unpressed
state.  Since this is an active low button, this means that you should
assume that RA2 starts out at logic 1 as shown in the figure above.

<pre>
	uint16_t start, end, duration;

	T0CONbits.T0PS = 0bxxx;		// It's your job to determine xxx 
	T0CONbits.PSA = 0;
	T0CONbits.TMR0ON = 1;		// Turn on timer 0

	while(PORTAbits.RA2 == 1);	// Wait for the start of pulse on RA0
	start = TMR0;
	while(PORTAbits.RA2 == 0);	// Wait for the pulse to end on PTT0
	end = TMR0;

	duration = end - start;
</pre>

Let's start our discussion by determining the prescaler.
Looking at your maximum period table, you should look for prescalers
that can accommodate the range pulse duration in the maximum period.
In our case this means that we should select prescaler starting from 1:16
because the maximum period for a 1:16 prescaler is 65.5 ms which can
accommodate a 50 ms pulse.  You could also select from 1:32 to 1:256
prescalers to measure the pulse.  However we will employ the general
rule that <u>when ever you have a choice of prescalers, use the smallest
to get the best timing resolution.</u> Hence the program above should
use a 1:16 prescaler, or  <font face="courier">T0CONbits.T0PS = 0b011;</font>
<br><br>

On initial inspection the code is straight forward; 
<font face="courier">start = TMR0;</font> is executed when the 
<font face="courier">while (PORTAbits.RA2 == 1);</font> while-loop exits.
This means that the RA2 pin was at a logic 1 and now at logic 0, the
falling edge of pulse on RA2.  The instruction,
<font face="courier">end = TMR0;</font> is executed when the 
<font face="courier">while (PORTAbits.RA2 == 0);</font> while-loop exits.
This means that the RA2 pin was at a logic 0 and now at logic 1, the
rising edge of pulse on RA2.<br><br>

On first glance you might assume
that the end count is always greater than the start count.  If this were
true then it should be obvious that the statement
<font face="courier">difference = end - start;</font> gives us the 
duration of the pulse in timer counts.  Before 
examining our assumption further, I need to make an important point:
<u>times measured by the timer subsystem are not represented
in the normal time-units we are familiar with like milliseconds.</u>
You would need to write some code to convert the timer counts into 
"normal" units.  Most of the time, we will have our program output 
the raw timer counts and rely on the person examining the output 
to convert from timer counts to familiar time units like milliseconds.
<br><br>

Now let's return to that assumption, "the end count is always greater 
than the start count".  This is a flawed assumption because the timer could
roll over between the start of the pulse and the end.  This would 
result in the end count being smaller than the start count.  It
would be normal to assume that this would cause the
<font face="courier">difference = end - start;</font> statement
to produce the wrong answer.  The truth is a little surprising; the
difference between an end and start time is not affected by a timer
roll-over.  We can prove this by borrowing from the definition of
the 2's complement.
<br><br>

Imagine that the timer rolled-over during the pulse's duration so
that end &lt start.  Since subtraction is equivalent to addition
of the 2's complement we can re-write 
<font face="courier">difference = end - start;</font> as
<font face="courier">difference = end + (2<sup>16</sup> - start);</font>.
We will analyze this expression and show that it accurately reflects
the number of timer counts between the positive and negative edges
of our pulse.
<br><Br>

The second term in this statement 
<font face="courier">(2<sup>16</sup> - start)</font>
is just the number of timer counts from the start of the pulse until 
the timer rolls-over (the timer rolls over when it gets to 2<sup>16</sup>.
The term <font face="courier">end</font> is just the number of timer 
counts from 0. This sum describes <u>exactly</u> what happened when the 
counter
rolled-over.  Consequently, the difference between the end and start times
accurately describes the number of timer counts regardless of an 
intervening timer roll-over.
<br><Br>


<li>
<b>Question:</b>How many 1:16 prescaled TMR0 counts go by during 50 ms?
<br>
<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
     1 second      1000 ms    16 clk    
    ------------ * -------- * ------- * x counts = 50 ms
    16*10^6 clks   1 second   1 count  

x = 50,000 counts
</pre>

<li>
<b>Question:</b> How many times would TMR0 rollover in 100 seconds with
a 1:128 prescaler? <br>
<b>Answer:</b>
<pre>
    16*10^6 clks  1 count   1 rollover 
    ------------ *------- * ---------- * 100 s = 190.7 rollovers
      1 second    128 clk   2<sup>16</sup> counts

So 190 roll overs.
</pre>
<br>

<li>
<b>Question:</b>
Starting at 0, what value would be stored in TMR0 after 450ms running with
a 1:4 prescaler? 
<br>
<b>Answer:</b> TMR0 will roll over because TMR0 only requires 16.4ms to 
roll over. So my first step in this problem is to compute how many times 
TMR0 rolls over.
<pre>
    16*10^6 clks   1 second   1 count   1 rollover
    ------------ * -------- * ------- * ---------- * 450 ms = 27.466 rollovers
      1 second     1000 ms     4 clk    2<sup>16</sup> counts
</pre>
From this we know that TMR0 will count up from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>-1 
27 times with 0.466 of a roll over left over. The second part of the 
problem will convert this 0.466 roll overs into counts.
<pre>
    2<sup>16</sup> counts 
    ---------- *  0.466 rollovers =  30,528 counts
    1 rollvers    
</pre>
So, starting at 0, TMR0 will end up at 30,528.  Note that when I computed
the number of roll overs, my fractional result contined many more digits
<u>which I retained</u> when performing the second calculation.  This is
why come of you get a marginally different answer when you multiply
2<sup>16</sup>*0.466.

To solve this problem we must first compute <i>The number of counts

only needs to count up by 65,536 - 43,981 = 21,555 counts. Then the
counter needs to count up to 0x1234 = 4,660.  This makes a total count
of 21,555 + 4,660 = 26,215.  Using dimensional analysis produced the
following solution.
