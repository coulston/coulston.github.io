<h1>Multiplication by constants</h1>
When you add two numbers the result can have at most one more digit than
the operands. For example, the 2-digit operands "50" when added to
itself, 50 + 50 = 100 yields a 3-digit result.  This result generalizes
as follows.  The sum of a pair of N-digit numbers generates a result
with at most N+1 digits.  Trying to "squeeze" a N+1 digit sum into 
a N-digit variable will generate an illegal result and a condition we
call overflow.

Multiplication is 
fundamentally different, the product of two numbers generates a
result that can have up to two times the number of digits as the
operands. For example, the 2-digit operands "50" when multiplied
by itself, 50 * 50 = 2500 yields a 4-digit result.  This result
generalizes as follows.  The product of a pair of N-digit numbers 
generates a result with at most 2*N digits. Trying to "squeeze" a 
2*N digit product into a N-digit variable will generate an illegal 
result and a condition we call overflow.

You can multiply a binary number by a power-of-2 by shifting it left
one bit.  The mat

<pre>
Given a 4-bit binary number B = b3 b2 b1 b0.  Using the definition of 
positional notation, these four bits are interpreted to have the value:
b3*2^3 + b2*2^2 + b1*2^1 + b0*2^0

Shifting B left one bit produces b3 b2 b1 b0 0.  Using the definition
of positional notation, these five bits are interpreted to have the value:
b3*2^4 + b2*2^3 + b1*2^2 + b0*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2*(b3*2^3 + b2*2^2 + b1*2^1 + b0*2^0) = 2*B
</pre>
A similar argument can be made that shifting a binary number to the right
divides it by 2.  The following table will come in handy during the next
exercises.

What follows is a sequence of problems that motivate our discussion.  For 
each of the following problems, you are to multiply an 8-bit integer,
called x8, or a 16-bit integer, denoted x16, by a constant and put
the result into a variable y8, y16, y24, or y32 depending on the
size of the result.

<ul>
<li>Multiply x8 by 8 and put the result into a variable y16.<br>
<font face="courier"> y16 = x8 << 3; </font>

<li>Multiply x8 by 10 and put the result into a variable y16.<br>
<font face="courier"> y16 = (x8 << 3) + (x8 << 1); </font>  
This works because 10*x = (8 + 2)*x = 8*x + 2*x 

<li>Multiply x8 by 21 and put the result into a variable y16.<br>
<font face="courier"> y16 = (x8 << 4) + (x8 << 2) + x8; </font>  
This works because 21*x = (16 + 4 + 1)*x = 16*x + 4*x + x 

<li>Multiply x8 by 7 and put the result into a variable y16.<br>
<font face="courier"> y16 = (x8 << 3) - x8; </font>  
This works works because 7*x = (8 - 1)*x = 8*x - 1*x 

<li>Multiply x8 by 8.5 and put the result into a variable y16.<br>
<font face="courier"> y16 = (x8 << 3) + (x8 >> 1); </font>  
This works works because 8.5x = (8 + 0.5)*x = 8*x + 0.5*x 

<li>Multiply x8 by 0.65625 and put the result into a variable y8.<br>
<font face="courier"> y8 = (x8 >> 1) + (x8 >> 3) + (x8 >> 5); </font>  
This works works because 0.65625*x = (0.5 + 0.125 + 0.03125 )*x 

<li>What is the smallest power of 2 such that when it is multiplied
by 0.65625 yields an integer?
<font face="courier"> 0.65625 * 32 = 21</font>
In other words we have expressed 0.65625 as a ratio (21/32)where the 
denominator is a power of two.  

<li>Multiply x8 by 0.65625 and put the result into a variable y8.<br>
<font face="courier"> y8 = (x8*21 ) >> 5; </font>  
This works works because 0.65625*x = 21*x/32 

<li>Multiply x8 by 0.6 and put the result into a variable y8. Your
answer may use multiplication by a constant.
<font face="courier"> y8 = (x8*154 ) >> 8; </font>  
This works works because 0.6*x (almost) = 154*x/256.  There are two
points to make.  First, you may have been annoyed that you could not produce
an integer representation for 0.6 when multiplying by powers of 2.
Most of the time this will be the case and you will just have to accept
the fact that with any numerical computation you will have error. When
working with 8-bit values, you should expect more than your fair share
of error.  Second, overflow.  When computing this value you are working
with intermediate values that occupy more than 8-bits.  Most of the
time the compiler will protect you when you perform this computation 
in one line of code as shown.  However you should exercise great care
when developing these algorithms as overflow cases can creep up when
you least expect and can be very difficult to debug.
