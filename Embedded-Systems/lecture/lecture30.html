<h2>Look up Table (LUT)</h2>
Lets say that you wanted to compute the square root of a value using
the PIC.  If you were lucky enough to have a compiler which
provided this function you could just use the math library functions.
On the other hand, if you did not have the use of such a library, you
would have to figure out a way to compute the square root.
<br><br>

There are a lot of ways that you could compute the SQRT function.  You
could crack open a math book and find an analytic expression which would
produce a value for the SQRT function.  Unfortunately, this approach 
often leads to timely computations.  Another approach would be to enumerate
every possible value of x and its square root.  We could then
<u>look-up</u> a SQRT in the table, by going to the row corresponding to
x and retrieving its value.  This approach seems silly
because it would use a lot of space.  If we reduced the size of the table
by eliminating some of the entries then we would save space at the expense
of introducing error - if you wanted the SQRT for x and its entry was
not in the table then you would have to use the closest x in the table.
A good compromise among all three of these design constraints (space,
time, and error) is to use interpolation in a partial look-up table (LUT).
<br><Br>

"Interpolation is a mathematical method of creating missing data. ...
There are many methods of interpolation, but one simple method would be 
to generate a new value by using the average of the value of the two values
on either side of the one to be created."  This average is also referred
to as linear interpolation.  <br><br>

Let's look at an example.  In the left graph we have the plot of some
hypothetical function f(x) shown in red.  We will store every fourth value of
f(x) at x = 0,4,8,12,16,20, and 24 and use these values to interpolate 
the values of f(x) for the other values of x.  For example, let's say that 
you wanted
to compute the value of f(7).  To do this we will approximate the actual
red function f(x) between x=4 and x=8 as a straight line between x=4 
and x=8 shown in orange at right. This linear approximation forms the
hypotenuse of the orange right triangle.  To determine the value of f(7) 
we take a portion of the orange hypotenuse between x=4 and x=7 forming the 
hypotenuse of a smaller green right triangle.
<br><br>


<br><img src="./img/lutGraph.jpg"><br><br>

To determine f(7) let's look at the orange triangle.  Since we have stored the 
values of f(4) and f(8), we know the height of the orange right triangle 
equals f(8)-f(4).  Second, we know the base length of the orange triangle
because we stored every fourth sample of f(x). The base length is 4.<br><br>

Now for the green triangle.  It has a height of f(7)-f(4) and a base
length of 3.  Since the the orange and green triangles are similar 
triangles, the ratio of each triangle's height to base is equal.  Doing
the math provides the equality.

<pre>
    f(8) - f(4)   f(7) - f(4)
    ----------  = ----------		Solving for f(7) yields
         4            3

f(7) = f(4) + 3/4(f(8)-f(4))

</pre>

<h3>Firmware concepts</h3>
Let's take this expression for f(7), extract some general concepts
and turn it into code. Let's start by storing the values of f(0),
f(4), f(8), ... f(24) into an array.  The next problem is how, given
the value of 7, do we get the index of f(4) or f(8) to use in our
calculation?  Since we sampled the function f(x) at every fourth value,
we need to know which "fourth value" is 7 closest to.  This is the same
as dividing 7 by 4 and discarding the fraction.  7/4 = 1.75 so we should
use index 1 from the array of stored function values.  This is f(4).
Adding 1 to the index always produces the next stored value, in our case
this is f(8).  Looking at the expression for f(7) all we need is 
a way to compute the "3/4".  This expression describes how far along 
through the "fourth value" we have traversed.  This is the same as
the fractional portion of 7/4 that we discarded earlier.  In our case,
this was 0.75 which is exactly 3/4.
<br><br>

The following firmware formalizes these observations. To compute the
value of f(7) the function will have x = 7.  I looked at the red graph
in the plot above and made a guess at the values of f(x) at the 
seven stored points and came up with the values 10, 20, 100, 60, 40, 
30 and 20.  The first thing you see in the f function below is these
values stored in an array <font face="courier">func</font>.  I used
uint8_t data type because all the function values are between 0 and 255.
<Br><br>
The first thing that our code need to compute is the index into the 
func array.  This is done by computing 7/4 and discarding the fraction.
We can do this by shifting 7 right by 2 bits.  I next computed the
value of f(8) - f(4) and stored it in a variable 
<font face="courier">delta</font>. This code ignores the possibility 
that delta could be negative.  For the most part this is not an 
issue as long as delta does not overflow and the output from the function
is a positive value.
Next, we need to compute the fraction 3/4.  This is done in two separate
steps, first we mask off the least two significant bits of x by ANDing
with 0b00000011.  This half of the fraction is stored in a variable
<font face="courier">frac</font>.  The other half of the computation, 
dividing by 4, is accomplished in the return statement when, after 
multiplying the delta value by frac, we divide by 4 (by shifting right 
2 bits).

<pre>
//----------------------------------------------
//----------------------------------------------
uint8_t f(uint8_t x) {

    uint8_t func[7] = {10, 20, 100, 60, 40, 30, 20};
    uint8_t index, delta, frac;

    index = x >> 2;
    delta = func[index+1] - func[index];
    frac = x & 0b00000011;

    return (func[index] + (frac*delta)>>2);
}

</pre>


<h2>Square Root</h2>
Now lets examine how to determine a square root.  The purple curve in
the graph below shows the true value of the SQRT function for the 
integers 0-15.   The yellow curve in the graph below represents the values
of the SQRT function for 4 equally spaced values.  These values are 
given in the table to the left of the graph.

<h3>Firmware for square root</h3>
We will create a function to compute the square root using linear 
interpolation with fixed-point.  We start by deciding on the 
fixed point representations  The input argument is a 4-bit integer
in the range 0-15. The output is a number between 0.0 and 3.99
and include some fractional part.  Since 8-bit values are the norm
with the PIC, it makes sense to make the output an 8-bit value, but
where to stick the decimal point?  Since the whole number portion of
the answer is in the range 0-3, it makes sense to have 2 whole number
of bits and 6 fractional bits.  Hence, the decimal is after the second
bits.  
<br><Br>

You may be concerned that the last entry in the square root table, 4.0, 
cannot be represented as a 2.6 format number.  You re correct.  
However, representing the value 4.0 would require us to change the 
format to a 3.5 format for a single numerical value.  If we choose instead
to approximate the value 4.0 as the 2.6 format number 0b11111111 we would
be awfully close to the actual value.  Furthermore, allowing for this 
small error in a single representation gains us an extra decimal point for
every output.  The decision was made to accept this trade-off.

Take a look at the Excel spreadsheet linked at the top of this lecture
and you will see that the actual value is 3.317, the value 0xD3 is equivalent
to 3.3 in 2.6 fixed point.  Not too shabby.

<h2>General theory</h2>
Look-up tables are wonderful creations; the same function is able to 
approximate any function just load up an array of sampled values into 
an array and use the same program structure.  For the sake of the following
discussion, call the input argument x.  The operations performed
in the look-up table function are dependent on:
<ul>	<li>The number of different possible inputs, denoted 2<sup>N</sup>.
	For example, in the 
	SQRT function, there were a total of 16 different possible inputs.
	In the image below, the different values of x are shown in blue.
	So for the SQRT fucntion, N = 4. 
	<li>The number of entries in the array, denoted 2<sup>M</sup>+1.
	For example, in the SQRT function, there were 5 entries in the 
	array.  
</ul>
The image below shows the values of x in blue, the values stored in the 
LUT array in green and the indicies of those LUT entries in red.  
Some observations:
<ul>	<li>The red lines below the array index numbers show the interval
	of x values associated with that array index.  These intervals are
	closed on the left and open on the right. So for example, the inputs
	[0 &hellip; 2<sup>N-M</sup>-1] are associated with f(0).
	<li>The last value of x, the blue 2<sup>N</sup> is not a legal
	input to the function and exists to provid a bookend for 
	interpolation in the last interval.
	<li>The last value store in the array f(2<sup>N</sup>) is the 
	bookend value for interpolation in the last interval.
	<li>Each array index interval has 2<sup>N-M</sup> values of
	x in it.
</ul>

<br><img src="./img/lutConcept.bmp"><br><br>

In order to perform the interpolation the bits of x are divided
into two parts; those that are used to index the LUT array and those that
are used in the interpolation.  Let's start with how to form the array
index.<br><br>

You should be able to note that you can derrive the array index 
by dividing x by 2<sup>N-M</sup> and discarding the remainder.  For 
example, a x value in the range [2<sup>N-M</sup> &hellip; 2<sup>N-M+1</sup>)
corresponds to array index 1.  Let this x = 2<sup>N-M</sup>+y.  Now,
(2<sup>N-M</sup>+y)/2<sup>N-M</sup> = 1 with a remainder of y. So this 
idea checks out.  Dividing x by 2<sup>N-M</sup> (and discarding the 
remainder) is equivlent to shifting x right N-M bits. Hence the line
of code <font face="courier">index = x >> (N-M);</font>
Let's now look at how to form the fractional component.
<br><br>

Let the value of x be associated with array index &alpha;
The interval from f(2<sup>&alpha;</sup>)(inclusive) &hellip; 
f(2<sup>&alpha;+1</sup>) (exclusive) is associate with 2<sup>N-M</sup>
values of x.  The fraction in the interpolation measures how far through 
this interval the value of x is.  In order to get into the interval we
used the most significant M bits of x.  The remaining least-significant
N-M bits are how far we are through the inteval.  Hence we have the line
of code <font face="courier">frac = x & 0b0001&hellip;1</font>, where there
are N-M 1's in the binary mask.

<li> Final project idea<br>
Make a room mapper by mounting an ultrasonic range finder on top
of the servo motor.  Program the PIC to step in 10&deg increments
from 0&deg to 180&deg.  At each step the HCS12 should stop, average 8
ultrasonic range values together, record this value in an array and
move to the next step.  After a complete sweep, your program should
plot the data as a text plot.  Let's examine an example and how you
could accomplish this.<Br>

The table below shows example data gathered from the ultrasonic rang
finder when placed in the middle of a square enclosure with tall walls.
The ultrasonic range finder gathered the data in the "Range" column.
The "Angle" column is provided for your reference.<br>

<br>

I computed the entries in the "Cos" column in Excel by multiplying the
cosine of row's angle by a scaling factor (in this case 128) and 
rounding to the nearest integer.  Your program would need to store
this array of cosine values in an array, <u>under no circumstances
should you ask the HCS12 to compute the cosine of an angle!</u>  I
performed a similar procedure to compute the entries in the "Sin"
column.<br><br>

I computed the entries in the "Range*Cos" column by multiplying the
"Range" entry by the "Cos" entry and dividing by a scaling constant
(in this case 4).  The scaling constant "squeezes" the range of the
ultrasonic range finder from 100's of centimeters to something that
you can plot on a 24 row x 80 column text terminal.  Additionally
the scale factor should be a power of 2 so that you can replace
division by a shift right operation.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Angle<td>Range	<td>Cos	<td>Sin <td>Range*Cos <td>Range*Sin
<tr><td>0<td>100	<td>128	<td>0	<td>25	<td>0

You can then plot the "Range*Cos" and "Range*Sin" data using a
text interface to produce somthing like the following.
