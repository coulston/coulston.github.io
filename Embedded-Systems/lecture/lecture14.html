<h1>Interrupts</h1>
In the coming discussion I will make references to hardware subsystems of
the PIC.  Hardware subsystems are computational units inside the PIC that 
are not directly related to the fetching and executing of instructions.  
Examples of hardware subsystems include timers and capture/compare/PWM
modules.  Each of these hardware subsystems has an interrupt flag.  Our 
programs have polled the interrupt flag, waiting until the flag has been 
set (by the hardware subsystem) indicating that the subsystem has completed 
some important task.  It is now time to start using the interrupt flags in a 
much more significant way, to give them the capability to call a special 
function.
<br><br>

An interrupt service routine (ISR) is a function called by hardware. 
Almost all the hardware subsystems in the PIC have the ability to call an 
ISR.  To do this the subsystem must be configured so that the subsystems
interrupt flag becomes the signal to stop running main and start running the 
ISR.  This is accomplished by setting the interrupt enable bit associated
with the hardware subsystem.  Since an ISR is called by hardware and not 
your program, your main program has no idea when the ISR will be called,
and cannot pass parameters to the ISR.
</ul>

At first you may find the concept of interrupts complex and unintuitive,
but they represent one of the most powerful capabilities of a 
microcontroller and your embedded systems toolbox.
<br><br>

Why should we bother with these odd functions?  Having an ISR is like
having a second program independent from main.  These little programs 
can handle mundane tasks only when mundane tasks need worked on.  This 
allows main to focus on the important command, control, and communications 
tasks.  In fact there are many different hardware subsystems inside the
PIC that can generate interrupts, take a look at page 107 of the 
PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet found on the class main web page.
<br><br>

In order to use interrupts in your programs you will need the following 
6 components somewhere in your program.

<ul>	<li>Hardware
	<ol start=1>	
		<li><font color=red>Configure hardware to operate as needed
			</font>
		<li><font color=orange>Configure hardware to generate an interrupt signal
			</font>
		<li><font color=gold>Enable global interrupts
			</font>
	</ol>
	<li>Interrupt Service Routine
	<ol start=4>	
		<li><font color=green>Associate interrupt vector with ISR
			</font>
		<li><font color=blue>Define actions for the ISR
			</font>
		<li><font color=purple>Clear the flag that called the ISR
			</font>
	</ol>
</ul>

<h3>Example program design</h3>
In order to better understand how you can use interrupts to perform useful
tasks, the example program generates a 50% duty cycle square wave with a
frequency of 352 Hz.  We will use timer 0 as the hardware source to keep
track of time and generate the interrupt signal.  Note that this program, 
basicInterrupt.c, is linked at the top of this web page.  Please download
and run it to verify what we are doing here.

<ul>	<li>Hardware
<ol start=1>	
	<li><font color=red>Configure hardware to operate as needed.
	Set up timer 0 to run with a 1:1 prescaler (the default),
	and an initial value of 0xA739.  We clear the interrupt flag
	for good measure in case it has already been set.  </font>
	<li><font color=orange>Configure hardware to generate an 
	interrupt signal.  Looking at register definition for the INTCON
	register page 109 of the PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet will show
	you that setting the TMR0IE bit will enable the timer 0 subsystem
	to generate an interrupt signl every time the TMR0IF flag is
	set (anytime that timer 0 rolls-over).  </font>
	<li><font color=gold>Enable global interrupts.  Setting the GIE 
	bit-field of the INTCON register enable the interrupt feature of 
	the PIC controller.  </font>
</ol>
<li>Interrupt Service Routine
<ol start=4>	
	<li><font color=green>Associate interrupt vector with ISR.  This
	is done using the compiler-specific function call syntax shown
	in the example program.  For the time being, all your interrupts
	will be high priority. </font>
	<li><font color=blue>Define actions for the ISR.  Since we want 
	to generate a square wave, we need to toggle the RC0 pin.  The
	expression <font face="courier">TMR0 = 0xA739;</font> set timer 0
	704 us before it will roll over.  Since it is the timer 0 roll over
	that causes the tmr0_isr to be called, ensures that it is called
	at the proper frequency.  </font>
	<li><font color=purple>Clear the flag that called the ISR.  The
	ISR is called when the TMR0IF is equal to 1.  If we did not clear 
	TMR0IF then tmr0_isr would be called immediately after exiting.
	This would cause the RC0 pin to toggle at a much higher frequency
	than we want and it would also not allow main any allotment of 
	CPU time.  While in this program, main has nothing to do, most of
	the time, we will have main doing use things. </font>
</ol>
</ul>

<br><img src="./img/isrStructure.jpg" border="5"><br><br>

Let's take a minute to verify to check that the prescaler for timer 0 
and the starting value for timer 0 are correct.  This starting
value needs to be for half the wave length of the 352 Hz wave because, as we
will saw, the ISR toggles the pin that generates the waveform (2 toggles
are required for a complete wave).
<br><br>

A 352 Hz waveform toggles once every 1.42ms.  The smallest timer 0 prescaler
that accommodates this duration is 1:1.  Using a 1:1 prescaler, let's use
units factoring to determine the number of timer counts that go by in 
&half; of a 352Hz wave.

<pre>
16*10^6 clk   1 cnt   roll over  1 pin toggle      wave           352 waves
----------- * ----- * -------- * ------------ * -------------  =  ---------
  1 sec       1 clk   x counts   1 roll over    2 pin toggles        sec
</pre>

Solving for x yields 22,727.  We will be using the roll-over flag for
timer 0 as the interrupt signal, so we need to determine the initial
value for timer 0 so that it rolls over in 22,727 counts.  Starting 
timer 0 at 2<sup>16</sup - 22,727 = 42,809 = 0xA739 will accomplish
this.
<br><br>

<h3>Example program analysis</h3>
Let's take a moment and examine how the basicInterrupt program runs.
To do this I like to ask myself the question, "Through time, what 
function is running?"  The answer to this question is
either main or the interrupt service routine; always one and never both.
In the image below, time flows from the left to right and the we see
the green bar indicating when main is in control of the CPU and red
bar when the tmr0_isr is running.  Below this a blue time line showing
the timer 0 count value.  Initially main (through the INIT_PIC function)
initializes the timer to 0xA739.  The timer slowly counts up, making its
way to 0xFFFF and then rolls-over to 0x0000.  The moment that the timer
rolls over to 0x0000, the INTCONbits.TMR0IF flag is set, causing main
to stop running and the tmr0_isr function to start running.  Inside the 
tmr0_isr function, the timer is set to 0xA739, pin RC0 is toggled, and
the INTCONbits.TMR0IF flag is cleared.  The tmr0_isr function then exits
and main resumes running.  This corresponds to the red bar ending and the
green bar starting.  The process of timer 0 counting-up, rolling over,
stopping main, running the tmr0_isr repeats indefinitely.

<br><img src="./img/interruptTimeLine.bmp"><br><br>

<h3>Subsystem interrupt interface</h3>
In order to enable the interrupt feature of the PIC, the hardware
must be configured to generate the appropriate signal to the MCU.
 Each interrupt signal has three bits associated with it.

<ul>	<li>Flag - when set (to logic 1) causes the hardware to generate an
		interrupt signal
	<li>Enable - when set enables interrupt signal to contact MCU
	<li>Priority - sets the relative importance of the interrupt signal
</ul>


<h3>ISR guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>The code inside an ISR should be simple.
<li>Never put an infinite loop inside ISR - unless you never
want to get back to main.
<li>I strongly discourage putting delay loops inside ISR. 
<li>Never put a delay that waits for user input inside an ISR.  For example,
do not put the following in an ISR:
<font face="courier">while (BUTTON == 0);</font>
inside an ISR.
<li>All communication between the ISR and main requires the use of 
global variables.
<li>Use interrupts to build software interfaces to hardware.  The
ISR will typically move data to/from the hardware and global variables.
<li>An ISR can alert main that it has collected new data by means 
of a global variable acting as a flag.  
<li>Avoid data processing inside ISR, instead have main do the
heavy lifting and communicate to the ISR through flags and global 
variables.
<li>Sometimes an ISR will need to retain a value between 
invocations.  In cases like this you will need to use a static 
variable.  The following is a typical example of a static variable 
declaration inside an ISR.
<br> <font face="courier">static int8 isrCounts = 0;</font><br>
The term <font face="courier">static</font> means that the variable
should retain between ISR invocations.  The assignment to 0 
<u>only applies to the first call to the ISR</u>, on every subsequent
invocation of the ISR, this assignment is ignored and the value from the
previous invocation used.
<li>Up to two ISR's can be activated on the PIC at any given time.
<li>Avoid calling function from within an ISR.  <u>Absolutely
never call a function from inside an ISR that is also called
from within main.</u>  Absolute chaos is a best case scenario.

</ul>

<h3>Advanced topics</h3>
Our PIC has 33 different interrupt sources.  These interrupts are 
split into three categories, resets, core and peripheral.
Reset interrupts correspond to events which should cause the MCU to 
restart.  Core interrupts are configured using the INTCONx registers
and generally correspond to legacy features (features found on older
generation PIC processors).  Peripheral interrupts
are configured using the PIRx, PIEx and IPRx registers and correspond
to more contemporary features of the 18F family of MCUs.
<br><br>


While there are up to 33 distinct sources of interrupts, there are
only three interrupt service routines, main, HIGH_ISR, and LOW_ISR
as shown in the following figure.
It may seem odd to call main an ISR, but its a subroutine that's
executed in response to an interrupt event.  

<br> <img src="./img/ISRstructure.GIF"><br><br>

This figure shows the interrupt sources on the left and what
action is taken when each occurs.  When a reset event occurs,
the MCU executes the "program" at address 0, which is most cases
is a GOTO instruction pointing to main.  When one of the other
interrupts occurs, the MCU will execute either the program at 
address 0x08 or 0x18 depending on how the interrupt priority
was configured.
<br><br>

Since their may be several different interrupt sources activating
an ISR, the first thing that an ISR must do is to poll all the
potential interrupt sources to determine which is responsible for
activating it.  The guts of the ISR should be simple and should be 
limited to moving the information collected by the hardware to
internal storage for further processing by main.  In some cases
it may be appropriate to perform basic data processing on this data.
In many cases, the ISR will alert main that it has collected new 
data by means of a flag.  All communication between the ISR and main
will require the use of global variables.  The last thing that an
ISR needs to do is to return from the interrupt using the RETFIE.
This instruction is automatically included in your C code whenever
you have an "interrupt" type function.
