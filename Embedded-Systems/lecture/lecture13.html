<h1>PWM</h1>
Pulse width modulated waveforms (PWM) are square waves with a constant
period  that are composed of a time high and time low that can change.
The ratio of the time high to the period, expressed as a percentage, is
called the duty cycle.  The average value (measured in volts) of a PWM 
waveform is the duty cycle multiplied by the amplitude (in volts).
The waveform has a constant period, but the duty cycle increases from left
to right.
<br><img src="./img/pwmWave.bmp"><br><Br>

PWM waveforms are especially useful to send "analog" control signals to devices 
that accept digital inputs.  For example, if you drive an LED with a 
PWM waveform you can adjust the perceived illumination level of
the LED by increasing or decreasing the duty cycle of the PWM waveform.
The change in the illumination level is typically something you would
expect to get with an analog control signal, but is being delivered as a
rapid sequence of digital (logic 0 and 1) signals sent to the LED.
An important caveat is that the frequency of the PWM waveform must be
higher than the lowest frequency n eye can detect the on/off flicker of
an LED.  This is typically around 100Hz, a frequency easily obtainable
by most microcontrollers.


<h2>Hardware</h2>
The 5 CCP subsystems can each be configured in a capture, compare or
PWM mode.  Unlike the capture and compare functions, the PWM mode
is driven by TMR2 or TMR4 or TMR6 which use an 8-bit counter as 
opposed to the 16-bit counter used in TMR0, TMR1, TMR3 and TMR5.
<br><br>

The PWM subsystem relies on two other registers to build the PWM
waveform, the PRx and CCPx registers.  The period of the PWM waveform
is determined by how long it takes TMRx to count from 0 to that value
contained in the PRx register.  When the TMRx count reaches the value in
PRx, TMRx is reset back to 0 and starts once again counting up towards 
the value in PRx.  While the TMRx count is less than the
value contained in the CCPx register, the output of the pin associated
with the PWM module is logic 1.  When the TMRx count is greater than
CCPx, the pin output if logic 0.   This hardware configuration is
illustrated in the figure below.


<br><img src="./img/picTimerPWM.bmp"><br><br>


A PWM waveform has two primary characteristics, the period and the
duty cycle.  Lets look at the more complex of the two first, the
period.

<h2>PWM Period</h2>
The PWM period is determine by the counting frequency of the TMRx and
the value contained in PRx.  As mentioned previously, the PWM
module only accepts TMR2, TMR4 or TMR6 as a source.  These timers
are 8-bit and have prescalers of 1:1, 1:4 and 1:16. The TxCKPS
bits of the TMRxCON register determine which prescaler is used
according to the assignment in the table below.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Prescaler	<td>TxCONbits.TxCKPS	<td>Max period
<tr><td>1:1		<td>0b00		<td>16 us
<tr><td>1:4		<td>0b01		<td>64 us
<tr><td>1:16		<td>0b10 or 0b11	<td>256 us
</table>

The maximum period of the PWM waveform would be when PRx equals
255.  Since the timers start counting at 0, this makes 256 counts.
In the calculation below the prescaler is set to 1:16 to determine
the maximum period of TMRx (and by extension the PWM waveform).

<pre>
    1 second       10^6 us    16 clk  
    ------------ * -------- * ------- * 256 counts = 256us
    16*10^6 clks   1 second   1 count 
</pre>

As shown in the figure above, when TMRx equals PRx, a reset signal
is sent to TMRx resetting it back to zero.  So, in order to create
a maximum PWM period, PRx should be set to 255.  You should use the
units factoring calculation above to determine the PRx value for
other PWM period.<br><Br>

<b>Question:</b><br>
What prescaler and PRx value should you use to create
a PWM period of if you wanted a PWM period of 100 us?<br>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
We always will default to using the smallest prescaler that achieves
the needed period.  So for 100 us, the table above shows that we need 
a 1:16 prescaler.  We 

<pre>
      1 second     10^6 us    16 clk   
    ------------ * -------- * ------- * X = 100us
    16*10^6 clks   1 second   1 count 

X = 100 counts
</pre>

So PRx should be set equal to 100.

<h3>PWM Duty Cycle</h3>
The TMRx associated with a PWM module counts up from 0 to PRx.  The
logic level of the PWM wave is determined by comparing the TMRx value
against CCPx.  When TMRx is less than the value contained in CCPx,
the associated pin equals logic 1.  When TMRx is greater or equal to
PRx, the associated pin is reset.

Determine the values of the following registers to generate
the PWM waveform on RC1 shown below.  Note, you are to use 
TMR4 (just because) and CCP2 (so that you can output on RC1).
<ul>	<li><font face="courier">T4CONbits.T4CKPS</font>
	<li><font face="courier">PR4		</font>
	<li><font face="courier">CCP2		</font>
</ul>

<!--
The period of the waveform is 5.5 * 20us = 110us.  Consulting
the maximum period table for timers, it looks like we need a 1:16
prescaler.  In order to configure the prescaler for timer 4, you
need to look up the bit-fields of the T4CON register found on page
171 of the PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet found on the class web page.
According to this table, a value of 0b10 for the T4CKPS field will
cause timer 4 to run with a 1:16 prescaler.
<br><br>

Now we can use dimensional analysis to determine the
values in the PR4 and CCP2 registers.  Let's start with the PR4
register by examining the number of 1:16 prescaled TMRx counts
go by during 110 us.

<pre>
16*10^6 clk   1 second   16 cnt   
----------- * -------- * ------ * 110 us =  110 cnt
 1 second     10^6 us    1 clk   
</pre>

Now, let's get the look at the duty cycle register, CCP2.  The waveform
in the figure above spends 3.6 divisions at logic 1.  At 20us/division,
this means that the waveform spends 3.6 divisions * (20us/division) =
72 us at logic 1.

<pre>
16*10^6 clk   1 second   16 cnt   
----------- * -------- * ------ * 72 us =  72 cnt
 1 second     10^6 us    1 clk   
</pre>

Now we can put this all together and answer the question:

<ul>	<li><font face="courier">TMR4bits.T4CKPS = 0b10;</font>
	<li><font face="courier">PR4 = 110;	</font>
	<li><font face="courier">CCP2 = 72;	</font>
</ul>

-->

<li>What is the resolution of the duty cycle?  In other words, if you 
increment the CCPx register by 1, how much does this add to the duration 
of the logic 1 pulse in a single period? State your solution in microseconds,
perform the calculation for each of the three prescalers and show your work
(units factoring) for full credit.

<!--
   1 second      10^6 uS    1 clk
-------------- * -------- * ------- * 1 cnt = 0.0625 us
16,000,000 clk   1 second   1 cnt

   1 second      10^6 uS    4 clk
-------------- * -------- * ------- * 1 cnt = 0.25 us
16,000,000 clk   1 second   1 cnt

   1 second      10^6 uS    16 clk
-------------- * -------- * ------- * 1 cnt = 1 us
16,000,000 clk   1 second   1 cnt
