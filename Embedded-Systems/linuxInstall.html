<h1>Mplab and XC8 Install on Linux</h1>
</center>


<h2>Mplab on Linux</h2>
One of the reasons that I chose to use the MPLab X IDE is that it is
available as a free download allowing student to use it on their own 
computers.  This supports an important
pillar of my teaching philosophy; to enable students to work 
independently to explore and solve interesting problems.  Unfortunately,
many engineering programs are PC only, leaving Linux users with awkward
solutions to work off campus.  Fortunately with a little work, Linux users
can install and use the MPLAB X IDE + XC8.  What follows are some guidelines
to help you through the process.
<br><br>

As a PC user I have not tested these!  I would, however, be more than 
happy to improve the quality.  Just send me 
an email at coulston@mines.edu with concrete suggestions on how to improve 
them.  Support your fellow and future Linux users.  That said, thanks to 
Connor for providing these.

These instillation instructions for MPLAB and XC8 were used to install the
software on a Debian based system. The only issue is that the installer 
doesn't create a launcher, so you will have to make one yourself.  Follow
the linked guide below for that. One tricky part is finding the 
actual application in their file folders - it is

/microchip/mplabx/v5.25/mplab_platform/bin/mplab_ide
</font>
