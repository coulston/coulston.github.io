<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two, read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions prescribed. You do not need to document bullet items. Make a record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy as your teams solution on Canvas using the instructions posted there.

Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions. Use complete English sentences when answering questions. If the answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the piece of art. Only include your answers, do not include the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.

<h2>Objective</h2>
To familiarize you with the digital to analog (DAC) conversion method
that converts a PWM waveform into an analog waveform using a low
pass filter.


<h2>External Hardware</h2>

Take a moment to verify that the discrete component (capacitor and resistor)
values from the low pass filter schematic (shown below) match those found
on your development board.

<img src="./img/lpf.bmp"><br><br>

Look at Figure 2 at the wikipedia page on the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallen%E2%80%93Key_topology">
Sallenâ€“Key topology</a> low pass filter.  Note the wikipedia article 
refers to corner frequency as f<sub>o</sub>
<ol start=1>
<li>What is the calculated corner frequency of our (2<sup>nd</sup> order) 
low pass filter?
<li>Draw a rough (theoretical) sketch of the frequency response graph 
for our second order low pass filter using the graph below.
<br><img src="./img/bode.bmp"><br><br>

</ol>

Finally, let's take a look at performance of the low pass filter
by plotting its frequency and phase response.  In other words, let's
draw a Bode plot for the filter. 
You are going to use a function generator to provide an input 
signal to low pass filter on your development board.  Be careful 
otherwise you might damage your board. To start, you will want
to make sure that the sine wave that you will be feeding into the 
LPF oscillates between 0V to 3.0V.  The following image and 
instructions will walk you through this process.

<br><img src="./img/functionGeneratorSetup02.jpg"><br><br>

<ol type="A">

horizontal scale to 500us, make sure that channel 1 is DC coupled,
and that the trigger level is around 1.65V,
</font><li><font color=blue>

Note the items in red are paramount to the safety of your development board.
The setup image shown above, is a properly setup function generator.
If you are uncertain if your function generator is properly setup,
please call for verification,
<br><br>

You are now going to use the function generator to send sin waves with
varying frequencies into the LPF input and measure the amplitude and
phase shift of the output waveform.  When you have set up everything 
correctly it should look like the following picture.  The steps in the
instructions will walk you though the setup.

<img src="./img/bodeMeasure.jpg"><br><br>

<ul>
<li>Install a jumper over the single RC2 pin of the "RC2/LPF_in" header
	leaving the LPF_in pin available,
<li>Attach the black ground clip of the function generator to the ground 
	loop of the development board,
<li>Attach the red signal clip of the function generator to the LPF_in
	pin of JP2.  It may simplify things to use one of your jumper
	wires.

When you have your scope setup correctly, you should see something like the 
following image.
<br><img src="./img/bodeScope.bmp"><br><br>

<ol start=3>
<li>Include a screen shot with the function generator set to 500Hz.  Make
sure that the screen shot includes the attenuation and phase measurements.
</ol>

Now you are ready to collect the data to draw your Bode plot.  Start by 
downloading the <a href="./filterWorkSheet.xlsx">filterWorkSheet</a>.
Open the spreadsheet.  Set the function generator to each frequency listed 
in column B and record the gain and phase measured by the oscilloscope
in the columns "Meas Gain" and "Meas Phase" respectively.  As you add
values you should see the Bode plots fill with data.  If a cell in the
Freq column does not have an entry, find the frequency (by adjusting the 
function generator) that generates the gain or phase listed in that row.
<br><b>Note</b>
<ul>	<li>The Keysight osilloscopes will display the phase
in the range [180&deg; to -180&deg;].</b>  So for example, if your LPF
generates a -190&deg; phase, the Keysight oscilloscope will display this
as 360&deg; - 190&deg; = 170&deg;  While is is correct, it will cause 
your phase graph to have an unsightly discontinuity.  Fix this by 
subtracting 360&deg; from any positive phase reported by the Keysight
oscilloscope. 
	<li>At low frequencies, the Gain and Phase measurements will
	not be realiablly reported by the Keysight oscillscope.  Please
	just use the defauly values provided in the Excel file.
	<li>You will see the gain of the Bode plot start to rise at 
	the high frequencies.  This is a result of the fact that our
	circuit has a non-zero amount of inductance  For more
	information check out

<h2>Firmware Experiments</h2>
This week's program generates an analog sine wave using the PWM
subsystem connected through a low pass filter.  Setting the duty
cycle of the PWM waveform changes the analog output of the LPF.
Doing this fast enough (but not too fast) allows you to produce
analog waveforms that you will play back through a speaker.
Given the right conditions, when a PWM signal is input into a low pass 
filter (LPF), the output of the LPF is the average value of the PWM signal.
For example, in the image below a 62.5kHz PWM waveform with a 20% duty cycle
is applied to a LPF (with corner frequency 724Hz).  The LPF will average
the PWM waveform generating a DC output with voltage 0.2*3.3V = 0.66V
on the output.  

<br><img src="./img/pwm2DC.bmp"><br><br>

As mentioned, there are right conditions under which a LPF can average
a PWM waveform.  The most important of these is that the corner frequency
of the LPF be much lower than the frequency of the PWM waveform.  A 
general rule of thumb is have the PWM frequency 10 times higher than the
corner frequency of LPF.  This 1 decade of frequency separation will 
give a second order filter (like the one on our development board), -40dB
of attenuation.  This will effectively remove the AC component of the 
PWM waveform and leave only a residual average.  Even with a good LPF 
you can observe a slight ripple on the output waveform.  The amount of
ripple is one characteristic of the quality of the DAC conversion.
<br><br>


As a first step to generating a sine wave, we will look at how the
the low pass filter averages the duty cycles contained
in the sin array.  To do this, configure your development board
and oscilloscope as follows.

<ul>
<li>Setup your development board to send the PWM output from RC2 to
	the LPF_in pin by placing a jumper over the two pin header,
<li>Use the terminal interface to the development board to generate a 
	sine wave using the "s" option,
</ul>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Ch1 probe		<td>RC2/LPF_in
<tr><td>Ch1 ground clip		<td>Dev board ground loop
<tr><td>Ch1 (scale) 		<td>2V
<tr><td>Ch2 probe		<td>LPF_out on L2A header
<tr><td>Ch2 ground clip		<td>Dev board ground loop
<tr><td>Ch2 (scale) 		<td>2V
<tr><td>Horizontal (scale) 	<td>1ms
<tr><td>Trigger mode		<td>Auto
<tr><td>Trigger source		<td>2
<tr><td>Trigger slope		<td>&uarr;
<tr><td>Trigger level		<td>1.65V
</table>

Make sure to:
<ul>	<li>If you enabled AC coupling on Ch2, set it back to DC coupling,
	<li>Align Ch 1 on the second lowest reticule,
	<li>Align Ch 2 on the second lowest reticule on the upper half
		of the display,
	<li>Align the horizontal position at the second left-most reticule,
</ul>

<ol start=5>
<li>Use the "s" function to change the 8-bit value used to set the 
PWM frequency and complete the following table.  
Use the Measurement button and find an option to measure the 
duty cycle of a waveform. 

The LPF output should be a flat line - the oscillations of the PWM
waveform are being averaged out by the LPF.  Use the ground
level and the number of volts per division to determine the 
LPF output (volt) value.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Duty Cycle (percentage)	<td>LoadDutyValue 	<td>LPF output (volt)
<tr><td>31%			<td>&nbsp;		<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>86%			<td>&nbsp;		<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>&nbsp;			<td>199			<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>&nbsp;			<td>22 			<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>&nbsp;			<td>&nbsp;		<td>0.48V
<tr><td>&nbsp;			<td>&nbsp;		<td>2V
</table>
</ol>

Instead of having you hit a key to advance through the sin array,
we will turn over that control to our program.  The image below shows
consecutive values from the sin array being sent to the 
EPWM1_LoadDutyCycle function.  The percentage duty cycle is calculated
by dividing the argument to EPWM1_LoadDutyValue by 256.  The input to
the LPF is shown in the top (colored) graph.  The output from the 
LPF is shown below the input graph.

<br><img src="./img/pwm2AC.bmp"><br><br>

You should notice that Vout does not make an instantaneous 
transition from one voltage output level to the next.  Instead the 
voltage level gradually changes like a charging RC circuit.  We will
examine this effect in the next question.

<ol start=6>
When the PWM duty cycle changes, the output from the LPF does not
respond instantaneously.  The "S" function changes the PWM duty cycle
from 0% to 100% causing the output from the LPF to change from about
0 to 3.3V.  Leave the oscilloscope setup the same and perform the
following.

<li>Use the "S" function to change the PWM duty cycle from 0% to 100%. 
Note, this creates a step input to the LPF.  Measure the rise time, 
denoted t<sub>r</sub> of the LPF output.  Remember
the rise time is the time required for the LPF output to go from 10%
of the final value to 90% of the final value.  You may find the 
oscilloscope cursors helpful in making this measurement.
You may find it useful to zoom out on the scopes horizontal division
(eg 5ms) and to use single mode to capture the rise.  

<li>Screen shot the rise time waveform as your answer to this question.

<li>Use the equation (familiar to some of you) 
t<sub>r</sub> = 2.2 / &omega;<sub>0</sub> where 
&omega;<sub>0</sub> = 2&pi;f<sub>0</sub> to compute the theoretical rise
time of the low pass filter.  

<li>Compute the percentage difference between the actual rise time and
theoretical rise time as the difference divided by the theoretical times
100.  Don't be surprised by signficant different (50% is not unusual).

</ol>

<h3>Spectral content</h3>

The following will not be graded as part of the inLab.  It is provided
in case you would like to experiment with the FFT and gain some
additional understanding of the relationship of periodic signals and
their spectral content.
<br><br>

In order to convert the PWM waveform into an analog sinusoid, the low
pass filter does its best to average the duty cycle of each PWM
pulse, however, some small portion of the PWM wave will get through.
The "hair spikes" that ride on the sinusoid are the edges of the PWM
waveform.   
The structure of this noise is difficult to understand when
viewing the waveform in the time domain.  However, by looking at
the output sinusoid in the frequency domain using the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) of the oscilloscopes, you can understand the spectral
composition of the noise and design strategies to reduce it.<br><br>

For the time being remove channel 2 from the display by pressing the
illuminated "2" button twice.  Add the FFT to the scope using the following
instructions:

<ul>
<li>[Math] &rarr; <u>Function: f(t)</u> &rarr; <u>Operator:	FFT</u>
<li>[Math] &rarr; <u>Source 1: 1</u> 
<li>[Math] &rarr; <u>Span: 100kHz</u> 
<li>[Math] &rarr; <u>Center: 50kHz</u> 
<li>[Math] &rarr; <u>Display Math &rarr; Math1</u> 
</ul>

You are looking at the frequency content of the unfiltered PWM
	waveform.  The big spike in the middle of the screen is the
	frequency of the PWM waveform (around 60kHz).  The sine wave 
	you saw on channel 2 (around 150Hz) is on the far left side
	of the display,
<br><br>

Experiment with the horizontal adjust for channel 1, adjusting it
	from 100ms/div to 100us/div.  The fidelity of the FFT increases
	as you provide it with more time-domain data until you saturate
	the FFT hardware with data, then the FFT just shrinks.  Before 
	you move to the next step, make sure that the time scale 
	is 10 ms/div.
<br><br>



<ul>
<li>Capture the FFT for the unfiltered PWM waveform (channel 1) and include 
	it as the answer to this question.
<li>Capture the FFT for the filtered PWM waveform (channel 2) and include 
	it as the answer to this question.  To do this you will need to 
	go back into Math mode on the oscilloscope and change the Source
	setting to channel 2.  Note the difference between the two FFTs.
	Explain why the FFT of the unfiltered PWM waveform (from the previous
	question) and FFT of the filtered PWM waveform (from this question) 
	look so different.  Hint, use the behavior of the Bode plot for the 
	LPF in your explanation.
<li>Keep the FFT at channel 2 and adjust the span of the FFT to 
	2k (and center at 1k) and capture the FFT 
	as your answer to this question.
</ul>


Disconnect the oscilloscope from your development and put the development
board aside for the following experiments.  For these experiments you are
going to feed a signal from the function generator directly into the 
oscilloscope and have the oscilloscope perform a FFT on the input signal
from the function generator.  Go ahead and connect the function generator
to the oscilloscope (see the setup image at the top of this page for help).
<br><Br>

As a first experiment, set the function generator to generate a sine wave
at 10kHz.  Adjust the FFT to have a span of 100kHz and a center at 40kHz.
Adjust the time base to 10ms per division (feel free to adjust the time 
base to increase/decrease the resolution of the FFT).  You may want to 
turn "off" Ch1 on the oscilloscope so that it does not crowd the screen
with the sine wave.  Do this by pressing the illuminated "1" button just
below the Channel 1 vertical adjust.
Note that the ground symbol represent 0dB.  Usually only one frequency 
spike will reach 0dB, this is usually the frequency of the signal that
you are applying.  The magnitude of the other spikes are measured 
relative to this level - when in Math mode the scope will display the
vertical dB/division scale.
<br><Br>

Adjust the frequency of the sine wave on the function generator and observe 
how the FFT of the sine wave changes.  Notice that there is always a large
spike on the extreme left side of the screen.

For the sine wave input answer the following questions.
<ul>
<li>How many Hertz are in 1 horizontal division?
<li>What is the frequency of the large spike on the extreme left of the
FFT?  What do we call a signal with this frequency? 
<li>Adjust the offset of the sine wave to remove the 1.5V DC offset.
Do this by pressing the [Offset/LoLevel] soft key until Offset is 
selected then enter the offset of 0V using the keypad.
What happens to the magnitude of the spike on the extreme left of the
FFT?
</ul>

From your previous course work you know that any periodic signal can
be represented as the infinite sum of sin waves using a Fourier series.  
For example a period function f(t) with period T, has a Fourier series:
<pre>
  f(t) = A0/2 + A1*sin(2*&pi;t/T) + A2*sin(2*2*&pi;t/T*t) + A3*sin(3*2*&pi;t/T) + &hellip;
</pre>

The function f(t) is characterized by the coefficients Ai in the Fourier
series.  Here is the cool part, the FFT function on an oscilloscope shows
you these coefficients without having to do any math.
<br><br>

Now switch the function generator to generate a 1kHz square wave.   Make
sure that the FFT span is 10kHz and the center is 5kHz.

<ul>
<li>Focus on the large spikes on the FFT.  Measure the frequency (in Hz)
and amplitude (in dB) of the first three spikes after 1kHz.  
<li>Switch the function generator to generate a ramp.  Focus on the 
large spikes on the FFT.  Measure the frequency (in Hz)
and amplitude (in dB) of the first three spikes after 1kHz.  
<li>Switch the function generator to generate noise.  How many 
spikes does the FFT look like?  Note this is a defining characteristic
of noise.
</ul>
