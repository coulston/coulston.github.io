Sodlering SD card to development board</center>

<h2>Attach SD card holder to development board</h2>
The SD card holder is purely a mechanical device that holds an SD card and connects 
the conductive fingers on the SD card to pins on the PIC. I have found making the
solder connection by "reflowing" solder paste with a soldering iron to be the most
effective way to connect the SD card holder to the development.  This technique
of "reflowing" solder paste with the soldering iron is useful in a range of 
repair and fabrication processes and well worth trying out today.
<br><br>

So follow along with these steps and you should find the process quick and 
efficient.

<ul>
<li><b>Step 1</b><br>
Start by getting a solder paste dispense gun, a tube of solder paste, and
a paper towel or something to clean up excess solder paste.  Turn the 
development board over on its back and orient the programming header to
the right.  The development board in the image below is orientated this
way.  In this orientation, the SD card holder is positioned on the 
bottom edge of the development board. <br>
Apply solder paste to the pads shown shown in the image below. Try to
apply about the same amount as shown.  It's easier to add more solder paste
later, than it is to remove solder later.
<br>
<img width=600 src="./sdCardImg/step01.jpg"><br><br>

<li><b>Step 2</b><br>
This is the most important step, align SD card holder on development 
board.  This is a bit tricky to get right because the "fingers" on
the SD card holder are somewhat inside the outline of the SD card holder.
Make sure that you have all the SD card holder fingers and tabs aligned
with shiny spots on the development board just like the image below.
<br>
<img width=600 src="./sdCardImg/step02.jpg"><br><br>

<li><b>Step 3</b><br>
Reflow the solder paste with the soldering iron onto the "fingers" of the
SD card.  Start by soldering one of the fingers on either the left or
right end of the set of fingers.  Do this by carefully positioning the 
chisel tip of the soldering iron at the end of the silver pad (furthest
from the SD card finger) and slowly move the soldering iron's chisel tip 
towards the SD card finger.  The solder paste will quickly transform into 
a smaller ball of solder which you will slowly push towards/on the SD card 
finger.  When the ball of solder meets the SD card finger, the solder 
should wick onto the pin and join the development board pad with the 
SD card finger.  If this doesn't work, try to solder the adjacent pin.<br>
When you have one pin soldered on one side of the set of finger,
<u>check the alignment of the SD card holder before proceeding</u>.  If
the SD card is crooked, take a moment to heat up the solder on the one
pin and fix the orientation of the SD card holder so that it aligns 
with the land pattern (silver pads) on the PCB.<br>
With one pin soldered and the SD card holder orientated on top of the
development board land pattern (silver pads), then solder one of the
SD card fingers on the other end of the SD card holder.<br>
Check alignment of the SD card holder then continue to solder the
remaining SD card fingers.  Make sure that you have a good electrical
connection between all the fingers and the silver pads on the 
development board.<br>
<img width=600 src="./sdCardImg/step03.jpg"><br><br>
Note, that the 4th pin from left looks like it needs some more solder.

<li><b>Step 4</b><br>
Solder at least two of the SD card tabs to the development board.
The tabs are the mechanical connection between the SD card and
the development board.  When you push the card into the holder
all that sheer stress is being placed on the tabs around the 
exterior of the SD card holder.  It's worth the time to make
extra sure that these connection are well made.<br>
I find this solder operation to be tricky because the solder seems 
to want to stick to the SD card holder tabs and not to flow onto 
the development board and make the needed connection.  I almost 
always need some extra solder to make a good connection.  Be
careful not to overdue it with too much solder or too much time
on any one tab.  If you are having a hard time with one tab, move
to another and let this one cool down.

	<li>In the Select Item pop-up navigate and select sdCard.h.  Since
	you have two files called "sdCard", be careful which you select.
	<li>Add sdCard.c to the "Source Files" folder in the Project tab
	using the same process.
</ul>
<li>Compile and download the code to the PIC.
</ul>
<br>

Experiment with the code as you read through the following text.<br><br>

The firmware provided in today's lab allows you to perform
some basic operations.  Let's look at these by first pressing
"?" to get the menu.

<pre>
-------------------------------------------------
SD card address:  0000:0000
-------------------------------------------------
?: help menu
o: k
Z: Reset processor
z: Clear the terminal
----------------SPI TEST-------------------------
t: send a Test character over SPI
--------------SD CARD TESTS----------------------
i: Initialize SD card
a/A decrease/increase read address
r: read a block of 512 bytes from SD card
w: write a block of 512 bytes to SD card
-------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<ul>
<li><b>i</b><br>
Before you use the SD card, you must first initialize it to operate in
SPI mode.  Try hitting the "i" key now.  The firmware you programmed 
will call the 
<font face="courier">SDCARD_Initialize(true);</font> function which 
establishes that the PIC wants to talk to the SD Card using SPI.  You
will get three pieces of feeback from this function; CMD0, CMD1 and
the block length command. When everything is working normally, you 
should get the following response.

<pre>
CMD0, Reset Response: 1
CMD1, Init Response: 0
Block Length Response: 0
</pre>

If you do not get this sequence (or if your PIC hangs), then you should
make sure that your SD card is inserted.  Then reset the PIC and try 
several more times.  If this does not clear things up, then you have an issue
with the solder connection between the PIC and the SD card holder.  Go back
and carefully re-examine the 4 solder connections (colored below) between the 
SD card and the PIC shown in the image below.

<li><b>a/A</b><br>
The example program allows you to read/write blocks of 512 bytes
to/from the SD card respectively.  These 512 byte blocks are located
at some starting address inside the SD card. The SD card address currently 
used as the starting address for these blocks is printed at the top of the 
menu as: <font face="courier">SD card address:  0000:0000</font>.  The 
'A' command increase the current SD card address by 512, and the 'a' command 
decrease the current SD card address by 512.  Be careful when decrementing 
the address that you do not underflow to a really high address.

<li><b>w</b><br>
Writes a block of 512 bytes to the SD card starting at the current
SD card address.  The 512 bytes written are two sets of decreasing 
values from 0xFF to 0x00.

<li><b>r</b><br>
Reads a block of 512 bytes to the SD card at the current SD card address.
The values in this 512 byte block are printed out in 32 rows of 16 bytes
each.  Each byte is printed out in two different formats in raw hex and
in ASCII.  For example, when I read a block that has just been written,
I get the following three rows.

<pre>
7f 7e 7d 7c 7b 7a 79 78  77 76 75 74 73 72 71 70   ~}|{zyxwvutsrqp

5f 5e 5d 5c 5b 5a 59 58  57 56 55 54 53 52 51 50    _^]\[ZYXWVUTSRQP
</pre>

You should consult an online ASCII table to verify some to these 
characters.  Note unprintable ASCII character my be displayed 
as '▒' or as '.'.

<li><b>t</b><br>
Sends one character over SPI.  This function will not be used in
today's lab.
