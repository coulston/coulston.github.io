Lab 12 - In-lab activities</center>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two, read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions prescribed. You do not need to document bullet items. Make a record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy as your teams solution on Canvas using the instructions posted there.

Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions. Use complete English sentences when answering questions. If the answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the piece of art. Only include your answers, do not include the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.

<h2>Objective</h2>
To familiarize you with the MIDI protocol so that you can produce a
specific note on specific instruments played at specific volume on
a specific channel.  Understand the behavior of the Hall effect sensor
when your simple piano key is pressed.

<h2>MIDI protocol</h2>
Right at the outset, this tutorial is not meant to be a comprehensive
overview of MIDI, nor does it necessarily use MIDI terms.  For the 
convenience of simplicity and expedience, I've modified some of
the terms.  I hope that this lab whets your appetite to learn more
about MIDI so that you explore this protocol further and better
understand the simplifications I've introduced.<br><br>

The MIDI protocol is a standard that connects devices to sound
producing equipment.  The protocol consists of a sequence of bytes
that form a message.<br><br>

Let's start in an obvious place, how to to get a MIDI device to play 
a note, called "pitch" in MIDI-speak.  To play a pitch you need
to send three bytes, the first is the start pitch command, the second
is the pitch and the third is the velocity. Velocity is the force
with which the pitch is played and roughly corresponds to the volume
of the played pitch.<br>
The start pitch command is 0x90<br>
The pitch is a numerical value between 0x00 and 0x7F<br>
The velocity is a numerical value between 0x00 and 0x7F<br>
So if you wanted a MIDI device to start playing a mid-range pitch (0x3C) at a 
mid-range velocity (0x64) you would send:
<font face="courier">0x90 0x3C 0x64</font><br><br>

Once played, the pitch will take a while to fade out.  If you want to 
play a pitch for a specific amount of time then after you start 
playing a pitch you will enter a delay loop for a specified amount of 
time, then the send the stop pitch command.  The stop pitch command
sends the MIDI device three bytes, the first
is the stop pitch command, the second is the numerical code of an already 
started pitch, and the third is the volume of that pitch.<br>
The stop pitch command is 0x80<br>
The pitch is the numerical value of a started pitch<br>
The volume is a numerical value of a started velocity<br>
So if you wanted a MIDI device to stop playing the mid-range pitch (0x3C) 
that was playing with volume (0x64) you would send:
<font face="courier">0x80 0x3C 0x64</font><br><br>

Most MIDI devices are capable of playing many different instruments.
To change an instrument you need to send the MIDI device two bytes, 
the first is the change instrument command and the second is the 
numerical code of the instrument.
The change instrument command is 0xC0<br>
The instrument is a numerical value between 0 and 0x7F<br><br>
You can get a complete list of instruments 
<a href="https://www.midi.org/specifications/item/gm-level-1-sound-set">
here</a>, but the table below lists a few.  Note the MIDI standard has
several different types of instruments for each class.  For example
in the guitar class you might have acoustic, electric, steel, 
12-string, etc&hellip;

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Instrument	<td>Code
<tr><td>Piano		<td>0-7
<tr><td>Guitar		<td>24-31
<tr><td>Percussive	<td>112-119
<tr><td>Sound effects	<td>120-127
</table>

There are times when you would like to play more than one pitch at
a time on different instruments, simulating an band like Radiohead
composed of a electric guitar, bass, drum and synthesizer.
To facilitate this, the MIDI protocol includes 16 channels, each 
channel may be dedicated to one instrument.  So if you wanted to 
play a song you could put the entire guitar score
on channel 0, bass on channel 1, drum on channel 9 and synthesizer on
channel 3.  How can you do this?<br><br>

The MSB of a byte tells the destination MIDI device if the byte is data
(MSB == 0) or control (MSB == 1).  A control byte is split into an upper
and lower half.  The upper 4-bits are the command and the lower 4-bits
are the channel number to apply the command to.  For example, 0x90 means
play a pitch on channel 1.  0x82 means stop playing a pitch on channel 3.
0xC1 means change the instrument associated with channel 2.  Did you
notice something weird about my numbering?  Humans talk about channels
1-16, while the MIDI codes use 0-15.  The reason is that musicians, like 
most people, start numbering things like channels at 1, while the computer
engineers who designed MIDI started numbering channels at 0.
<br><br>


MIDI pitch 69 is A4 and has a frequency of 440 Hz.  To see the entire list
go to <a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/donbyrd/INFO545Site-Spring07/MusicalPitchesTable.txt">here</a>. If you 
do know the relationship between the position of a note and its pitch,
check out the Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clef">Clef</a>

I would encourage you to pluck this tune out on the piano located on
the ground floor of Brown building (well when you have access to Brown
building again).  You may want to print or write-out 
the diagram that converts notes into piano keys using this
<a href="http://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/piano_notes.jpg">link</a>.
Oh, and play all B notes as B flat; that's what the flat symbol (looks like
a half heart) located on the left side of the staff means.

<h3>Hall effect sensor</h3>
A Hall effect sensor is a device that produces a voltage in the presence
of a magnetic field.  A variety of different types of sensors
use this effect to produce an output that indicates the presence of
a magnetic field.  Your development board comes equipped with a Texas
Instruments DRV5053 Analog-Bipolar Hall Effect Sensor.  This analog
sensor has a nominal output of about 1V.  
The presence of a North or South magnetic field causes the output 
voltage to change.
The analog output of our DRV5053 is connected to an ADC pin on the PIC.

<ol start=2>
<li>Get the Digikey part number for the DRV5053 from our Bill of Materials,
posted in inLab01.  Open the Datasheet for the DRV5053 to determine 
what magnet field causes the output voltage to decrease.  Hint, it's on
the very first page of the tech docs.

<li>Using the PIC's schematic posted on the class web page, what 
pin of the PIC is the DRV5053 connected to?
</ol>

<h3>Assemble your piano key</h3>
In order to complete this lab, it would help to have:
<ul>	<li>a piano key,
	<li>piano key guide template,
	<li>a rubber band, and 
	<li>a strong (neodymium) magnet
</ul>

When assembled, the act of pressing the key will move the neodymium magnet
closer to the hall effect sensor, causing the output of the Hall
effect sensor to change.  You will write firmware in this week's lab
to interpret these changes into MIDI tones that will be produced on
a connected PC.
<br><br>

Since we are not able to meet IRL, I've put the plans for all of the 
parts (sans rubber band and magnet) in a PDF file for the
<a href="./cutOutForPianoKey.pdf">plans for holder, key and template</a>.
If you can print these out you can use them to carefully cut cardboard
or some other ridge material for your piano key and other parts.


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Step		<td>Image
<tr><td>Get your supplies organized.  
	<td><img src="./img/assemble00.jpg">
<tr><td>Insert the neodymium magnet into the piano key.  If the magnet
	is too lose (and falls out), put a couple of small pieces
	of paper into the magnet slot then wedge the magnet in place.
	Make sure that the magnet is orientated so that as the key is
	pressed, the voltage produced by the Hall effect sensor decreases.
	<td><img src="./img/assemble01.jpg">
<tr><td>Line up the cardboard guide so that the round opening is 
	just below the Hall effect sensor on the other side of the board.
	<u>Check this at least twice to be sure.</u>
	<td><img src="./img/assemble02.jpg">
<tr><td>Hold the piano key on the cardboard guide (on the PCB) so that:
	the curved side of the piano key contacts the PCB and the long 
	tab of the piano key hangs over the edge of the PCB.
	<td><img src="./img/assemble03.jpg">
<tr><td>Strap the piano key to the PCB with the rubber band making sure
	that the rubber band engages the cardboard and piano key cut outs.
	<td><img src="./img/assemble04.jpg">
</table>

You will press the piano key on the flat side above the neodymium magnet,
the rubber band will return the key to its neutral position when the
piano key is released.  You may find that holding the PCB steady while
pressing the piano key creates more consistent key action.

<h2>Internal Subsystem</h2>

<h2>Firmware Experiments</h2>
There are two main components to this week's lab, piano key press and MIDI.
Consequently, let's perform some experiments with each.

<h3>Piano key Experiments</h3>
Let's start by figuring out which side of your magnet is North and which
is South.  Use the "1" function to take individual readings from the
Hall Effect sensor as you move your magnet over the Hall Effect sensor
on the development board.

<ol start = 4>
<li>What is the minimum and maximum value you can produce with 
your magnet using the "1" function. Try moving the magnet below 
the hall effect sensor on the bottom side of the PCB.   
</ol>

Take a moment to mark the side of the neodymium magnet that causes the
voltage output to decrease when the magnet is approaches the bottom of
the PCB opposite the hall effect sensor.  You need to do this because
the program that you download to the PIC expects the ADC readings to
decrease as the key is pressed.  You could mark this side with its
magnetic polarity (North or South) using the information you found out
in an earlier question.

Let's examine what a "piano key press" looks like when plotted through time.
Start by downloading the <a href="./inlab12.xlsx">inlab12.xlsx</a> spreadsheet
and storing it somewhere safe.  Start by calibrate your inlab12 program to 
your piano key. This is required because due to difference in the 
size and construction of your key, the value your program returns when
a key is pressed and unpressed may differ significantly between students.
<br><br>

Use the "1" function in the inlab program to experiment with the readings
from the Hall effect sensor when the key is pressed different amounts.
<br><br>

Use the "c" and "C" functions to calibrate the levels of the Hall effect
sensor when the key is unpressed and fully pressed.  Your program will need
these values to properly detect when the user is pressing the piano key.
Open the inlab12 Excel spreadsheet and enter these values into cells C2
and C3.  Note that I have indicated cells where you should modify values
by coloring them grey.  If a cell is not grey, I do not expect you to
modify its value.
<br><br>

Look at the code associated with the "t" function to answer the following
questions.
<ol start=5>
<li>There are three main phases to this function.  Use the program comments
and the code structure to describe these three phases.
<li>In the first phase, the program is waiting for some condition
before it starts acquiring samples.  Describe in your own words,
what this condition is.  An answer that consists of a line of code will
not receive credit.
<li>How long is the wait between consecutive samples?
<li>How can you change the period between consecutive samples?  In other
words, what program function(s) achieve this?
<li>Delta is a value which helps to specify the threshold at which a 
keypress is detected.
If you increase the value of delta, does it take the program a longer
or shorter time to detect a piano keypress?
<li>Would a large or small delta value make it easier for noise in 
the output of the Hall effect sensor to trigger a false piano keypress
event?
</ol>

Now let's look at the keypress event as captured by your program
in Excel using our inlab12 spreadsheet.  Start by looking at the
data presented in PuTTy terminal.

<pre>
-------------------------------------------------
    Nominal 62 to 29
    delta = 5
    sampleRate = 1000 TMR0 counts = 1000uS
-------------------------------------------------
?: help menu
o: k
Z: Reset processor.
z: Clear the terminal.
d/D: decrement/increment delta
s/S: decrement/increment sampleRate
c/C: calibrate unpressed/pressed hall sensor.
1: report a single Hall effect sensor reading.
t: wait for piano keypress and report 64 samples, one every 1000us.
M: enter into Midi mode.
-------------------------------------------------
Tap a piano key.
  58   57   56   56   56   55   54   53   51   50   49   47   46   45   43   41   40   39   39   38   38   37   37   37   37   37   36   36   36   35   35   35   35   35   35   35   34   34   34   34   34   34   34   34   34   34   33   34   33   34   34   33   34   33   33   34   34   34   34   34   34   34   34   34
</pre>


Using your mouse, select this data in the PuTTY terminal window.  Note, 
selected text 
in PuTTY is automatically put into Windows copy buffer.  Open the 
<a href="./inlab12.xlsx">inlab12.xlsx</a> Excel file and paste the data 
into cell location H3.  More than likely Excel will make a mess out of this
by pasting all 64 samples into cell H3.  To straighten this out, select
cell H3 and then select Data &rarr; Text to Columns.
<ul>	<li>In the "Text to Columns Wizard - Step 1 of 3" pop-up 
		select the Delimited radio button, then next,
	<li>In the "Text to Columns Wizard - Step 2 of 3" pop-up 
		select "Space" Delimiter, then finish,
	<li>If you get a pop-up warning that there is already data here,
		just OK it away.
</ul>
The 64 entries should now be distributed across 64 columns.  
You should not have to specify the delimiter in subsequent pastes as
Excel uses this as the default for subsequent paste operations.
<br><Br>

You may encounter a blank cell in cell H3 created by the first space in the 
data being given its own column, shifting the first data value
into cell I3.  You can fix this by deleting the empty entry in cell 
H3 and shifting all the data in row 3 left one position.  Do this by
right mouse clicking cell H3 and selecting "Delete&hellip;".  In the
Delete pop-up select the "Shift cells left" radio button and "Ok".
If your careful at selecting the text you can eliminate that leading space.
<br><br>

Collect data for a medium speed piano key press and a slow piano key press 
pasting them into their respective rows in the Excel spreadsheet.
When complete, you should get a graph that looks something like the 
following:

<br><img src="./img/excel.bmp"><br><br>

<ol start=11>
<li>Show your Excel plot as the answer to this question.
<li>Complete the code segment in the “t” function to measure the 
keypress velocity.  The velocity is the index of the stored array
where the sampled value drops below the "nominalHallPressed + delta",
the bottom red horizontal line in the excel plot above.  If the sampled values
from the Hall effect sensor never drop below the bottom red line, then make
the velocity 64 (the length of the array) plus the amount that the 
last sample is above the red line.
In the above excel plot, the velocity of:
<ul>	<li>the fast key press, dark blue, is about 12,
	<li>the normal key press is about 41,
	<li>the slow key press is 64 plus the amount that the last
	sample is above the red line.  In other words 64 + (40 - 34) = 70.
</ul>
Submit your code snippet as the answer to this question.
</ol>

<h3>MIDI Experiments</h3>
You will find that the Hairless MIDI Serial Bridge works just fine if you play 
nice with it.  One of the most important things I have found is that you 
need to establish a Serial port connection with the MIDI Serial Bridge
program <u>before</u> you start sending it data.  Since the serial port
is an exclusive resource, this means that you will <u>need to exit 
PuTTY and connect the Hairless MIDI Serial Bridge before sending MIDI
data from the development board.</u><br><br>

Channel 10 is reserved for percussion instruments.    Most instruments
are played in such a way that the pitch is sustained for some 
duration that you would like to control.  Percussion instruments are
different; they are played by being struck. Hence you have very little
control over the duration of the sound.  Thus, when playing a percussion 
instrument on channel 10, there is no need to send a stop command.  
Second, the pitch field in the MIDI message to start playing on channel
10 is reinterpreted to be the <u>instrument being played.</u>  For a
complete list of the percussion instruments, look at the bottom of the
instrument web page.
<br><br>

Modify the inLab program by playing all the instruments in the
percussion channel.  You need to modify four lines of code to make this
happen.  The percussion instruments are listed at the bottom of 
<a href="https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/gm-level-1-sound-set">
this</a> page.  Remember to subtract 1 from the channel number because
we are starting numbering from 0.  As a matter of style you may want
to increase the delay of each percussion instrument is played.
<br><Br>
In order to test your modified code tun the "m" function and follow the
instructions provided by PuTTy.
