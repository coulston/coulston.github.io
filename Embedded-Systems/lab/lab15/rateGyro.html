<h1>Rate Gyroscope Experiment</h1>
</center>
<br>

The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate how to apply the output of the rate
gyroscope to determine how much you have spun a friend in a chair.
<Br><br>

Configure the Lab 15 Firmware to record the rate gyroscope.  Have a friend hold the 
development board/daughter board combo, start logging data and spin them clockwise 
and counter clockwise, keeping track of how many times you have turned them each way.
<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Spool the data into a csv file.  
<li>Open this csv file in Excel and immediately save it in the native Excel format.
<li>Make a column to the left of the raw data which is the time (in seconds) for each sample.
<li>Make a column called degree per second.  Each entry in this column is the raw data converted
into a degree/second value using the full scale range of the gyroscope that you configured.
<li>Make a column called degrees moved per sample.  Each entry in this column is the 
degree/second entry multiplied by the sampling period of the gyroscope that you configured.
<li>Make a column called degrees moved overall.  Each entry in this column is the sum of all 
the degrees moved per sample up to that time.
</ul>
<br><br>

Your graph should looks something like the following.  Make sure that the horizontal axis 
is in seconds time units by multiplying by the sample period.

Fully label your axis and title your graph with a description of how you rotated your
friend.  For example, I should have titled my graph 3 CW, 2 CCW. Perform the experiment 
three times with different numbers of rotations.
