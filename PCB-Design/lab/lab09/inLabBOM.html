In Lab 9 - Bill of Materials</center>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two,
read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions
prescribed.  You do not need to document bullet items.  Make a
record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy
as your teams "inLab" assignment at the start of next weeks class.
Word process your solutions.
Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions.
Use complete English sentences when answering questions.  If the
answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an
oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the
piece of art.  Only include your answers, do not include
the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.


<h1>Objective</h1>


<h3>Copy Lab 8 EAGLE files into Lab 9</h3>
I would like to you to keep a copy of the work completed so far
in lab08 and use it as a starting point for lab09.  To do this:
<ul>	<li>Create a lab09 folder, 
	<li>Launch EAGLE CAD,
	<li>Navigate to the lab08 directory so that you can see the
	orange "E" for lab08,
	<li>Right mouse click on the orange "E" to the left of lab08,
	<li>Select Copy
	<li>In the Copy directory pop-up, navigate into the lab09 directory,
	<li>Click "Select Folder",
	<li>In the Control Panel, right mouse click on the orange "E" to
	the left of lab08 (in the lab09 project),
	<li>Select rename,
	<li>Change the name of the project to lab09
	<li>Rename lab08.sch to lab09.sch in the same way,
	<li>You can delete lab08.pdf by right mouse clicking on it 
	and selecting delete.
</ul>

<h3>Eagle BOM</h3>

It seems that I spend as much time selecting components for my PCBs than
I do laying out the PCB.  I guess what I am trying to say is that the
parts list for a PCB, called the bill of materials (BOM), represents 
a significant investiment of time

<ul>	<li>Open your BOM excel file,
	<li>Add a new tab and call it EAGLE BOM,
	<li>Launch EAGLE,
	<li>Open the project and open the schematic,
	<li>File &rarr; Run ULP&hellip;
	<li>In the ULP pop-up select bom then click OK,
	<li>In the EAGLE: Bill of Material pop-up select
	List type: Values, Output format: CSV,
	<li>Click View,
	<li>In the Eagle: Bill Of Material - Preview pop-up
	click on any portion of the text and press 
	Ctrl-A to select all the text then press
	Ctrl-C to copy all the text into a buffer,
	<li>Open Excel,
	<li>Right mouse click on cell A1,
	<li>Select Paste - Match Destination Formating (M).  This is the
	clipboard with paper icon,
	<li>Data &rarr; Text to Columns,
	<li>In the Convert Text to Columns Wizard Step 1 pop-up, select
	the Delimited radio button,
	<li>Click next,
	<li>In the Convert Text to Columns Wizard Step 2 pop-up, select
	Semicolon,
	<li>Click Finish.
</ul>

You should end-up with something that looks like the following image.
You can and should cut off the columns to the right of "Description"
(Column F), leave the Description column.

<h3>Digikey BOM</h3>
Each of the items in the Eagle BOM represents an item that you may need
to purchase.  Note that some of the items in the BOM, like mounting holes,
are contained on the finished PCB, so do nbot need purchased.
<br><br>

There are significant variations in how BOM's are documented across 
industry and even for different vendors.  My BOM's have a 
header for each vendor that parts are ordered from.  Below the vendor
name are the fields that identify cruical information for each part.
These include:
<ul>	<li>Description	
	<li>Manf	
	<li>Manf Part #	
	<li>DigiKey Part #	
	<li>Foot	
	<li>Unit Cost	
	<li>Qty/Board	
	<li>Total
</ul>

<br><img src="./img/digikeyBOMoutput.bmp"><br><Br>

Let's look at one item on our BOM, the TLC274D, and fill in the 
information using Digikey's parametric serarch.  Start by opening
a browser and navigating to digikey.com.  Enter "TLC274D" into the
main search box and hit enter.

<br><img src="./img/mainDigi.bmp"><br><br>

No results!?  Usually when you get a no-result from Digikey, it means
that you have been too specific.  So let's simplify the search to the
more general "TLC274", leaving off the last character.  You should get
something that looks like the following image - the particular result
you get wil probablly be slightly different as Digikey's inventory
changes day-to-day.

<h3>Net review</h3>
Perform a net-by-net review of your design.  This will require a
computer running EAGLE CAD, a paper copy of your schematic, a
pencil and highlighter.  Perform the following steps to get ready
for this process.

<ul>	<li>Launch EAGLE CAD,
	<li>Open your project,
	<li>Open the schematic and layout side-by-side so that they
	occupy the entire screen,
	<li>In both the schematic and layout, click Zoom to fit, the 
	magnifying glass with a black rectangle,
	<li>In the schematic, select the information tool,
	<li>Click on a part,
	<li>The Properties pop-up for that part is highlighted in the 
	layout,
	<li>Click Ok to remove the Properties pop-up,
	<li>In the schematic click on the Name tool,
	<li>In the schematic click on a wire,
	<li>The Name pop-up for the wire (showing its name) is
	highlighted in the layout,
	<li>Click OK to remove the Name pop-up.
</ul>

Remember that a net is a named interconnection of electrical devices.
A net is a logical circuit element, meaning that we use it as a place-holder
for something real.  When you "route a net", you transform the logical
net connections into physical connections with wires.  In any first 
generation design, it is a good idea to verify that the each net is 
routed correctly.  In other words, verify that the physical wires 
corresponding to the net connected to all the intended devices.
<br><br>

To do perform the following set of stes for each net in the schematic.
<ul>	<li>Select it using the Name tool,
	<li>Write the net's name on its wire in the schematic,
	<li>If the net has a defined name, then place a check next to the
	given name,
	<li>For each device that the net (in the schematic) connects to:
	<ul>	<li>Verify that it is connected in the layout,
		<li>Highlight the schematic pin corrsponding to this
		connection.</ul>
	<li>Repeat for all the nets in the schematic.
</ul>
