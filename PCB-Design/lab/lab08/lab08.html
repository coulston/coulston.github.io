<h2>Lab 8 assignment</h2>
Layout your power supply - the whole thing.

Guidelines:
<table border=1>

<tr><td><center><b>Components</b></center>

<tr><td>Place the following components on the edge of the board:
<ul>	<li>Heat sink
	<li>On/Off switch
	<li>Power connector
	<li>Spring terminal block
</ul>
<tr><td>Have switch near power connector
<tr><td>Have LED near switch
<tr><td>Place heat sink away from controls (fingers that will be
	manipulting them)
<tr><td>Put Iset and Vset pots near one another and in a row or column
<tr><td>Place components on 50 mil grid
<tr><td>Align adjacent resistors in rows and column
<tr><td>Each of the four mounting holes should be near one of the board corners

<tr><td><center><b>Board</b></center>
<tr><td>Make the board outline rectangular
<tr><td>Board dimensions should be on 0.1" grid
<tr><td>Make the board outline as small as reasonably possible
<tr><td>Center mounting holes on 0.1" grid
<tr><td>Place mounting holes symmetrically
<tr><td>Route wires on 20 mil grid

<tr><td><center><b>Wires</b></center>
<tr><td>Use 16 mil wires
<tr><td>Do not use the autorouter
<tr><td>Avoid routing wires between close pins
<tr><td>Avoid routing wires between 1206 pads
<tr><td>Avoid 90&deg; bends in wires
<tr><td>Avoid routing on the bottom layer
<tr><td>Use ground via's when convenient

<tr><td><center><b>Copper pours</b></center>
<tr><td>Copper pour ground on the bottom plane	
<tr><td>Copper pour power on the top plane
<tr><td>Exactly align top and bottom pour exact

<tr><td><center><b>Silk screen</b></center>
<tr><td>Uniform font and size for part designators (name and value)	
<tr><td>Uniform location for part designators on similar parts
<tr><td>Add "on"/"off" text near the switch with correct orientation
<tr><td>Add "CURR" next to Iset pot and "VOLT" next to Vset pot
<tr><td>Add polarity, voltage and current details next to DC power input jack

<tr><td><center><b>Optional</b></center>
<tr><td>Add Blaster ftw

<h2>Turn-in</h2>
This is an individual assignment.
<ul>
<li>Find and accept the Google drive invitation for the EENG 393 folder
sent out by me.  Go into this folder and find the folder named 
"first.last"  where "last" is your last name and "first", your first name.
This is your folder, please create a folder inside it called "version 1",
This is where you will store your initial design.
<li>When you complete your layout, copy your ".sch" and ".brd" files 
into your folder.  Please copy both files.
</ul>
Note: Everyone has access to everyone else's folder - do not make this
the primary repository for your schematic and layout.  And do not copy
anyone else's layout - I shouldn't even have to say this.
<br><br>


Print your layout as a PDF using the largest scale that allows your
layout to fit on one sheet of 8.5x11 in landscape if you like.  Make
sure to have Visible Layers set to Preset_Standard as shown below.
Upload the PDF to Canvas.
