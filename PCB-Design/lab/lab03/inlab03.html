<h2>Requirements</h2>
When you have worked through all the material in this lab writeup, please
take the inLab 03 Quiz. You may find quiz questions to be similar to,
but not identical to the numbered questions in this inLab write up.
Note, you wil have 60 minutes to complete the ten questions in the
Canvas quiz so it would be a good idea to complete all the inLab 
activities before taking the Canvas quiz. Do not turn in the answers 
to the numbered questions in this inLab writeup.

<h3>LED</h3>
Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are polarized devices meaning that they 
have positive and negative leads.  Current flowing from the positive 
to the negative lead causes the PN junction inside the LED to
emit photons.  The current flowing through the PN junction produces 
a voltage that follows the current vs. voltage graph shown in the 
image below.

<br><img src="./img/ivDiode.bmp"><br><Br>

The LED is supposed to be operated around the forward voltage V<sub>f</sub>
level.  Notice that at this point the slope of the I vs. V graph is 
large.  This means that small changes in the voltage will produce large 
changes in the current.  This means that adjusting the brightness of an 
LED using the voltage knob of a power supply is difficult - either the LED
is to dim or you over-voltage the LED and destroy it.  The high slope of
the I vs. V graph also means that changes in the current through the LED
produce small changes in the voltage.  Thus, it makes much more sense
to try to adjust the brightness of an LED using current.
<br><br>

The notion that the forward voltage of an LED as <u>the</u> voltage 
that illuminates the LED is a bit misleading.  V<sub>f</sub> is a 
representative value that produces a "normal" amount of illumination.
You can measure V<sub>f</sub> using the bench digital multimeters (DMMs)
as follows.
<ul>	<li>Power on the DMM using the white button on the lower left corner,
	<li>Connect banana plug cables into the DMM.  Black into the COM and
	red into the jack labeled with a diode picture,
	<li>Set the DMM into diode mode by pressing the button with a 
	black diode symbol on it,
	<li>Attach the red cable to the anode of the LED (longer lead) and
	the black cable to the cathode of the LED (shorter lead),
	<li>The LED should dimly illuminate,
	<li>The DMM display will indicate the forward voltage, V<sub>f</sub>
	with way more precision than needed.
</ul>

<br><img src="./img/measureVf.jpg"><br><br>

On almost every circuit that I build, I include a power-on LED.  This
LED provides me with a positive indication that the power input is 
satisfactory.  It also serves as a useful debugging tool, turning
off if I somehow short-out the power in the circuit, or dimly illuminating
if I am over stressing the circuit.  An LED with a series resistor 
placed across the power rail is an easy way to provide this function.

<br><img src="./img/lightLED.bmp"><br><br>

The value of the resistor is pretty easy to figure out if you know
V<sub>f</sub> and the amount of current that you want to flow through
the LED, I<sub>f</sub>.  The datasheet for the LED should have these
values.  As a general rule I limit the current through power-on LEDs
to no more than 5mA as I find their glare distracting.  The calculation
to determine the value of the resistor is as follows.

<pre>
Voltage across resistor		Vcc - V<sub>f</sub>	
Ohm's law for resistor 		Vcc - V<sub>f</sub> = I<sub>f</sub>*R
Solve for R			R = (Vcc - V<sub>f</sub>)/I<sub>f</sub>
</pre>

When selecting an LED for an application you should take the following
characteristics into consideration.

<dl>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>It's pretty obvious that the color is an item that you can select.
However, there are trade-off's involved.  For example, the color in
large part determines V<sub>f</sub> with longer wavelengths having
lower V<sub>f</sub>.</dd>

<dt>Forward voltage</dt>
<dd>As state before, V<sub>f</sub> is not an absolute value, but a 
representative value that will cause the LED to produce near
maximal illumination.</dd>

<dt>Continuous forward current</dt>
<dd>Since the LED has a voltage drop while current is running through it,
the LED necessarily dissipates power.  The LED gets hot while doing
this and can handle only so much power before the PN junction fails.
It is wise to operate LEDs well below their peak current to prolong
their lifetime operation.</dd>

<dt>Pulsed forward current</dt>
<dd> In some applications, like IR communications, it is better to pulse
the LED with very high currents for brief periods of time.  In IR
communication, this has the potential to greatly increase communication
range.  Some data sheets will provide the duration of the pulse, 
frequency of pulses, and the current for the pulses.  Pulse currents
of 1A are not uncommon for small 5mm LEDs.  </dd>

<dt>Size</dt>
<dd> The most common through hole LEDs are in a T-1 3/4 case, sometimes called
a 5mm case because the LED is 5mm in diameter.  I typically use 1206
surface mount LEDs as they are easy to handle and as small as the other
SMT discretes that I use.</dd>

<dt>Brightness</dt>
<dd> The brightness of an LED should be measure in millicandela (mcd), where 
one candela is the luminous intensity projected over a 1 sterdian solid
cone.  Anything over about 50mcd is annoying to look at.</dd>

<dt>Angle</dt>
<dd> The rear of the LED housing is formed into parabolic cone in order to
 increase the number of photons leaving the LED.  The shape of the cone
determine the range of the light ray angles emitted.  All things being
equal, narrow beams have a longer range, while wide beams are seen at
a wider range of angles.</dd>

The fact that a DMM will dimly illuminate an LED can be a very useful tool.
Let's say that you have a 7-segment display with no technical documentation.
In order to use it, you need to know what the pins are connected to.  To
accomplish this first configure the DMM as shown in the image above.  Then,
connect the common (ground) lead to one of the 7-segment leads and swipe the
red lead across the pins of the 7-segment display while keeping an eye on
the individual segments of the display.  If no segments light up, try a 
different common pin on the 7-segment display.  Continue and you will
eventually get a segment to light up.  Then this is the time to start
building your own pin-out with pencil and paper.

<h2>LED flower schematic</h2>

The LED flower contains a single 10mm common anode RGB LED powered
through a 9V battery.  Three potentiometers, wired in rheostat mode,
provide a current limiting for the LEDs.  This allows a user to adjust
the amount of light coming from the red, green, and blue LEDs creating
a rich pallet of colors.

In order to draw the "&ohm;" symbol, first make sure that Num Lock is on,
then, while holding down the "Alt" key type "234" on the number pad, then
let go of the Alt key - presto, &ohm; symbol.





<h2>Power Supplies</h2>
The goal of this course is to build a power supply unit (PSU) that
can regulate voltage and current.  The ability to regulate 
voltage is something that I think should come naturally to most 
EE student because we often are often asked to power a circuit with some 
specific voltage.  <u>When you set a voltage limit on the power supply
you are telling the PSU to deliver no more than this amount of 
voltage to the load</u>.  My guess is that in most labs you have
seen the PSU deliver that set voltage to any load you have connected.
However, the supply will only deliver the full voltage so long as the 
current consumed by the load does not exceed the current limit set on 
the power supply.
<u>When you set a current limit on the power supply you are telling
the PSU to deliver no more than this amount of current to the 
load</u>.  
<br><br>

The combination of voltage and current limit means that
<u>the PSU is always limited by either the set voltage limit or 
set current limit</u>.  A power supply will always give you some means
of setting the voltage limit (VSET knob in the image below) and of
the setting the current limit (ISET knob in the image below).  We will
call the voltage delivered to the load VOUT and the current delivered
to the load IOUT.

<br><img src="./img/simplePSU.bmp"><br><br>


Let's take an example where a power supply is configured with 
VSET=10V, ISET=1A and a 2&ohm; load attached across the output 
terminals (VOUT and GND in the image above).  How much voltage
and current will the power supply deliver to this load?  As
mentioned above, the power supply will deliver the set voltage
or current to the load, determining which is a matter of correctly
applying Ohm's law.
<pre>
If VOUT = VSET = 10V then IOUT = 10V/2&ohm; = 5A
If IOUT = ISET = 1A then VOUT = 1A*2&ohm; = 2V
</pre>
From this you should be able to deduce that the power supply will
have VOUT=2V and IOUT = 1A.  Because if the power supply had VOUT=10V,
then the output current would have to be greater than the maximum 
allowable current limit set by the user (which was 1A).
This combination of VOUT=2V and IOUT=1A is marked on the graph below
with a red circle labeled 2&ohm;.
<br><br>

<ol start=4>
<li>
Determine the value of VOUT and IOUT for loads of 
6&ohm;, 
10&ohm;, 
40&ohm;, 
80&ohm;, 
100&ohm;, 
1k&ohm;, 
1M&ohm; on a power supply configured with VSET=10V and ISET=1A.
Mark them on the graph below and annotate each point with its
resistance.
<br><img src="./img/graphVvsI.bmp">

<li>You should remember that the power delivered to the load is VOUT*IOUT.  
In the graph above, this is just the product of the x,y coordinates of
each resistance point.  What is the trend in the power delivered to the 
load as you move from low to high resistances?

<li>You have configured a power supply with set values of VSET and ISET.
What load resistance will result in maximum power transfered to the load?
State your answer in terms of ISET and VSET. 

<li>Complete the following graph of the expected power supply behavior
with ISET=1A and a load of 10&ohm;.  The user will be increasing VSET
from 0V to 20V.  Draw a graph of the values of VOUT.<br>
<img src="./img/voutVsVset.bmp"><br><br>

<li>Complete the following graph of the expected power supply behavior
with VSET=10V and a load of 10&ohm;.  The user will be increasing ISET
from 0V to 2A.  Draw a graph of the values of IOUT.<br>
<img src="./img/ioutVsIset.bmp"><br><br>

</ol>

The following activity requires you to manipulate the bench power supplies.  
In particular you will need to manipulate VSET and ISET and read out 
VOUT and IOUT.  The following
image shows the controls and relevant areas of the display to effectively
interact with the power supplies.

<h3>Adjusting voltage and current limit</h3>
The following instructions will require you to change VSET and ISET,
hold the load resistance constant and measure VOUT and IOUT.
You will be using the bench PSUs, banana/banana cables and a 
a 10&ohm;, 5 Watt power resistor from the "Power Resistors" drawer.
