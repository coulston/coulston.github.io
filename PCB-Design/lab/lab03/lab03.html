<h2>InLab 3</h2>
Some self-guided <a href="./inlab03.html">activities</a>.  Complete prior to taking
	the Canvas quiz.<br>
Guidance on <a href="./layout.html">layout</a> of the RGB LED from the schematic. This
page contains the RGB LED schematic.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>	
	<li>Basics of LEDs
	<li>Constant current and voltage from PSU
	<li>Creating complex board outlines
</ul>

<h2>Lab 3 assignment</h2>
Complete the following assignment individually or in teams of at most two.
<br><br>

I need your help to design a creative outreach activity to teach
people how to solder and through this increase their interest in
Electrical Engineering.  For this activity, you will be constrained
to used the LED flower circuit provided to you in this inLab.  
The following are the objectives:

<ul>	<li>Rotate layout to minimize bounding box area,
	<li>PCB must fit in a 75mm x 100mm bag,
	<li>Mimic some object,
	<li>The mimicked object should use color in some logical way,
	<li>The object should be reasonably gender neutral,
	<li>Something that your mom would approve of,
	<li>Solder mask color available from 
	<a href="https://jlcpcb.com/">JLC PCB</a>,
	<li>Place components to enhance appearance,
	<li>Mines theme?,
	<li>No sharp points.
</ul>

Before turning the assignment in, please:
<ul>
        <li>Run the DRC with the vuMeter Design Rules rule set provided
        to you in the previous lab.  Clear all warning and errors.
        <li>Print your layout to PDF as follows:
        <ul>    <li>File &rarr; Print,
                <li>In the Print pop-up,
                <ul>    <li>Printer: Microsoft Print to PDF
                        <li>Orientation: &lt;whatever best accommodates the 
				layout&gt;
                        <li>Alignment: Center
                        <li>Area: Full
                        <li>Scale factor: &lt;bigget possible to fit a 
				single page&gt;
                </ul>
        <li>Click OK,
        <li>In the "Save Print Output As" pop-up, navigate to your lab02
        directory and give your file a meaningful name.
        </ul>
        <li>Upload your PDF to Canvas in the "Lab 3 - RGB layout" assignment.
</ul>
