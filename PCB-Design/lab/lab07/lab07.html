<h3>Lab 6 schematic</h3>
After finishing lab 6, your schematic should similar to the following.
After creating the footprints in the table above, you should replace
the circuit elements circled in red. Also make sure to place the pair 
of linear regulators (the LP2985 and LP2983) and their associated 
bypass capcitors.  Note that these capacitors are 1206 form factor, 
not Panasonic_B used previously.

<h3>Lab 7 schematic</h3>
After replacing the components above and adding the additional parts 
called for, your schematic should look like the image below.  
You will need this completed schematic as the starting point for 
your lab next week.
<br><br>

You will notice that the signals into the pair of DPDT switches are
not properly designated.  The last thing that you need to your
schematic is to figure out how to get the VU meter to operate in
ont of the following modes:
<ul>	<li>Display V_SET
	<li>Display I_SET
	<li>Display V_OUT
	<li>Display I_OUT
</ul>
To accomplish this, you will need to set both the inputs to the top of
VU meter to their correct values.  This means that the input to
the VU meter's voltage divider circuit should be either 1V or 10V.
The input to the non-inverting inputs of the VU meter op-amps should
be the one of the four display signals listed above.  The DPDT switches
will allow you to switch pairs of signals to accomplish this.
<br><br>

Complete the circuit in your schematic by placing the existing net
names on <b>A-J</b>.

<h2>Turn-in</h2>
This is an individual assignment.
<br><br>

Print the footprints for the LT3080, ON/OFF switch and the terminal block as 
PDF files using a scale factor of 5.  Print the revised 
schematic of your uSupply as a PDF so that it fits on one page (scale factor 
about 0.9 should work) with the new parts and those asked for in the assignment.  
<br><br>

Combine these PDFs into one file - you can use the combine your PDF files
using https://combinepdf.com/  (Links to an external site.)in the following order:
<ul>
<li>Page 1 - Revised schematic
<li>Page 2 - LT3080
<li>Page 3 - ON/OFF Switch
</ul>
