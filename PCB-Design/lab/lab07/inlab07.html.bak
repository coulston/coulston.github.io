***In Lab 7 - EAGLE schematic &rarr; layout</center>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two,
read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions
prescribed.  You do not need to document bullet items.  Make a
record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy
as your teams "inLab" assignment at the start of next weeks class.
Word process your solutions.
Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions.
Use complete English sentences when answering questions.  If the
answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an
oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the
piece of art.  Only include your answers, do not include
the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.


<h1>Objective</h1>

Objectives
<ul>
<li>Nets, display name, air wires,
<li>The information tool,
<li>Packages,
<li>EAGLE files,
<li>ERC,
<li>Devices with multiple circuits,
</ul>


<h3>Copy Lab 6 EAGLE files into Lab 7</h3>
I would like to you to keep a copy of the work completed so far
in lab06 and use it as a starting point for lab07.  To do this:
<ul>	<li>Create a lab07 folder, 
	<li>Launch EAGLE CAD,
	<li>Navigate to the lab06 directory so that you can see the
	orange "E" for lab06,
	<li>Right mouse click on the orange "E" to the left of lab06,
	<li>Select Copy
	<li>In the Copy directory pop-up, navigate into the lab07 directory,
	<li>Click "Select Folder",
	<li>In the Control Panel, right mouse click on the orange "E" to
	the left of lab06 (in the lab07 project),
	<li>Select rename,
	<li>Change the name of the project to lab07
	<li>Rename lab06.sch to lab07.sch in the same way,
	<li>You can delete lab06.pdf by right mouse clicking on it 
	and selecting delete.
</ul>


<h2>Electrical Rule Check</h2>
To some extent, EAGLE CAD has built-in error checking that can help you 
identify errors early in the design phase.  Let's give it a try with
the circuit you built this past week.  Click Tools &rarr; ERC.  This 
will produce ERC Errors pop-up that looks like the following:

<br><img src="./img/ercPop.bmp"><br><br>

Double click on any of the errors and your window will be centered
on the error with a black pointer highlighting the error.  The list
of errors in the image above are all safe to ignore.  The first
two errors show conflicting types for the LM317 output and the VCC.
The first two warnings tell us there are conflicted types for the
supply pins of the op-amp and the VIN/GND pins.  The next two warnings
tell us that we have an unconnected op-amp inside the TLC274P (not a 
best practice).  The last warning tells us that we could give the 2N2222
transistor a value.
<br><br>

If you have any additional errors, you will need to fix them before 
moving on.
<br><br>

You can clear all the electrical errors and warning using the Clear all
button and then close the window.  Now let's create a real electrical 
error and see what it looks like&hellip;

<h2>Create LT3080 part in EAGLE</h2>

Let's build a footprint for the LT3080 from the information in the
device's technical documents.  To get the technical documents:
<ul>	<li>Go to <a href="http://www.digikey.com">Digikey.com</a>, 
	<li>search for LT3080,
	<li>On the results page, select "PMIC - Voltage Regulators - Linear",
	<li>In the parametric results selector, select "Through Hole" as the 
	Mounting Type,
	<li>Click the red "Apply Filters" button.  I 
</ul>
I ended up with three LT3080's to choose from.  On of them has a minimum
quantity of 1,000, so it's not a viable option.  The other two have
manufacture part numbers "LT3080IT#PBF" and "LT3080ET#PBF".
Click on one of these two to get to its product information page.  On the 
product information page, find the link to the LT3080 Datasheet in the
Datasheet area of the Documents & Media table.  Open the LT3080 datasheet.
<br><Br>


Go thought the datasheet
until you get to the Package Description for our device package.
There are two views, one from the front and one from the side - we
will have to infer the overhead dimensions from these two.  Talking
about dimension, you will note that each measurement as a bunch of
difference numbers associated with it.  You will have to makes sense
of these in order to build a good footprint for you PCB.
<br><br>

<img src="./img/TOmech.bmp"><br><br>

As an example of the dimensioning, the image has a red box around
the dimension representing the width of the metal heat-sink.  
The pair of numbers above the horizontal line represent a range
of possible sizes.  Interpret the string ".390 - .415" as "from a
minimum of .390 to a maximum of .415".  I use the average of these
two values, .403 as the actual dimension.  The horizontal line
separates dimensions with different units, metric and imperial.
There is no text on this page of the technical documents that 
help tell which is which.  In this case I have four ways to tell:
<ul>	<li>Scroll <u>up</u> through the other mechanical diagrams
	and look for some text related to units.  In our case, on
	the page preceding this mechanical diagram, the 5-Lead
	Plastic DD package contains the text " DIMENSIONS IN 
	INCH/(MILLIMETER)" which seems to imply that the numbers 
	above the horizontal line are imperial and those below
	are metric.
	<li>Metric units are always some units of meters and
	imperial units are always in units of inches.  Since there
	are 25.4mm per inch, I try multiplying one of the values
	by 25.4 to get the other.  Let's use the pair 0.390 and
	9.906 from the image above and determine which is imperial
	and metric.  I do this by first assuming that 0.39 is in 
	inches and converting it into millimeters.  I then assume
	that 0.39 is in mm and convert it to inches.  Then whatever
	conversion results in 9.906 was the correct starting point. 
	<pre>
	              25.4 mm
	0.39 inches * ------- = 9.906 mm
		      1 inch


		   1 inch
	0.39 mm  * ------- = 0.015 in
	           25.4 mm

	</pre>

	So it looks like the top number is in imperial units and the
	bottom number in metric.  This is consistent with the first
	method, so I have high confidence that this is correct.

	<li>Most electronics packages are standardized, so you may
	be able to find a separate resource that more clearly 
	defines the units.  For example, go to the 
	 massive <a href="http://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/supportDoc.do?type=drawing">ON Semiconductor</a>
	web page for Package Drawings.  In the Package Drawings Search box
	(left side of page), enter "TO-220" and click "Search."  I
	picked the first 5-pin package "TO-220 5 LEAD" and while not a
	perfect match, has some familiar numbers as shown in the image 
	below.

	<br><img src="./img/onSemiTO200.bmp"><br><br>

	These numbers again confirm that the top number is imperial and
	the bottom is metric.

	<li>As a last resort, I grab a measuring device and measure the
	physical package.  For this I find my digital vernier's to be
	the best tool for the job.  If you do any amount of PCB layout
	seriously considering purchasing a $40 pair from a company
	like TechniTool.  The only drawback with this method is that
	you need the part in your hands before you can start drawing
	the footprint and there will be times when you have to layout
	a part without having it in your hands.

</ul>

Use the image below to complete the pair of tables that follow.


<br><img src="./img/TOfoot.bmp"><br><br>


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Dimension</td>	<td>Name</td>	<td>Value (mm)</td>
	<td>Value (inch)</td>	</tr>
<tr><td>A</td>	<td>Width</td>	<td>&nbsp;</td>	<td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>
<tr><td>B</td>	<td>Depth</td>	<td>&nbsp;</td>	<td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>
<tr><td>C</td>	<td>Pin offset</td>	<td>&nbsp;</td>	<td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>
<tr><td>D</td>	<td>Pin pitch</td>	<td>&nbsp;</td>	<td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>
<tr><td>E</td>	<td>Pin diameter</td>	<td>&nbsp;</td>	<td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>
</table>

In the same image shown above, use the blue pin numbers to identify the
names of the pins as shown on the second page of the LT 3080 technical
documents.  Use the information from the mechanical diagram to determine
the location of the center of the pins assuming that the origin (0,0)
is located the blue cross shown.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Pin</td>	<td>Name</td>	<td>Location (mm)</td>
	<td>Location (inch)</td>	</tr>

<h3>Create a library</h3>

<ul>	<li>Close the lab07 project,
	<li>From the Control Panel select File &rarr; New &rarr; Library
	<li>In the Library Editor pop-up select File &rarr; Save
	<li>In the Save-As pop-up enter your last name as the File name,
	<li>Click Save.
</ul>
	

<h3>Create a new package</h3>
EAGLE CAD calls footprints, packages. So let's create a package for
our LT3080.

<ul>	<li>Click Library &rarr; Manage packages &hellip;
	<li>In the Edit pop-up Enter "TO-220-5R" in the New Footprint  Name field,
	<li>Click OK
	<li>In the Warning pop-up, click Yes to create a new package,
</ul>

You will now enter the package editor.  This is a basically a drawing
application with special features for PCB design.  You are going to draw
the LT3080's footprint; how you would view its outline and pins from above. 
To do this, you will use several tools pointed-out in the following 
image.

<br><img src="./img/packEdit.bmp"><br><br>

<h3>Draw the outline</h3>
Thr outline of a footprint serves much more than a asethetic role on
a PCB design.  A well drawn outline provides needed information to
the layout engineer so they position the component effectively and 
information to the assemblers so they can correctly install components.
<br><br>

Take the LT3080 footprint shown in the image below.   The positions of the
pads are correctly placed for the device, but at first glance its not 
obvious where the back of the TO-220-5 package is.  This is really 
important information because you are going to need to place a heatsink
on the back of this package.  Furthermore, even if we knew which side 
of the footprint the heatsink was on, we do not know how far away the 
heatsink needs to be placed.   Even if your design did not need a heatsink
you may need to place other components around the TO-220-5 package.
Safe placement requires knowledge about teh outline of the neighboring
parts.
<br><img src="./img/LT3080pinOnly.bmp"><br><br>

A footprint serves more than just to alert the layout engineer of the 
physical dimensions of the component.  Let's take the Phoenix terminal
block used on your power supply and shown in the image below at left.
In addition to the outline, the footprint can aide the layout engineer 
which side of the terminal block wires connect to and where the user
has to press in order to insert and remove wires.  These features 
help the layout engineer position the terminal block so that wires can
esaily be inserted and that the user can press the button without their
fingers being burned by a nearby heatsink.  If the mechanical documents
lack the specifics on a needed package dimension, do your 
best to guess-timate the value.  If you think that you need to, make a
note of your assumptions in the tDoc or bDoc layer.
<br><img src="./img/phoenix.bmp"><br><br>

As shown in the Phoenix terminal block, other features of the component
like the shape of the green plastic may be included. This helps add a 
level of realism to the device making it easier to identify on a busy
PCB layout.  Another function for a good outline is to help assemblers
install polarized components correctly.  Devices like ICs and LEDs need
some convienent reference on the PCB to determine the part orientation
so that the part can be intalled correctly.
<br><Br>


The tool used to draw the package footprints has many of the same tools
as the interface used to draw schematics.  However, there are some important
difference as shown in the image below.

<br><img src="./img/padType.bmp"><br><br>

<ul>	<li>Click view &rarr; grid,
	<li>In the Grid pop-upi:
	<ul>	<li>Display:	On
		<li>Style:	Lines
		<li>Size:	0.2 mm
		<li>Multiple:	1
		<li>Alt:	5
		<li>Click OK		</ul>
	<li>Select the Line tool,
	<li>Make sure that layer 21 tPlace is selected
	<li>Make an outline for the TO-220 package using the dimensions
	you found in a previous problem.  Make sure to have the lower
	edge of the package centered on the origin.
</ul>

<h3>Pad, Hole and SMT</h3>
The next step in the creation of a footprint is adding the electrical
(pads and smt) and physical (hole) connections to the PCB.  You will make
electrical connections to the PCB using pads and smt.  Holes are needed
for devices which are subject to mechanical stresses like a mounting holes,
USB connector or switches.  Hole do not have electrical connections.
<br><img src="./img/holePadSMT.bmp"><br><br>

The major difference between holes and pads is the presence or
absence of through-hole plating.  Through-hole plating is the process 
by which a conductive plating is added to the sides of the drill hole
and extends to the top and bottom surface of the PCB.
This conductive plating serves many useful purposes, creating a large
solder area between the PCB and the leaded components and allowing 
traces on the top and bottom sides to be connected through the hole.
<br><br>

A drill hole that has conductive plating added is called a plated through 
hole, PTH for short.  The plating inside the hole has some thickness which
reduces the usable diameter of the hole.  In EAGLE you specify  a
"drill" diameter which is the finished diameter of the hole in the PCB.
If this is a PTH then it is up to the PCB manufacturer to over-drill the
diameter of the hole so that after plating the finished hole diameter 
matches the value that you specified in your EAGLE file.  In other words,
you, as the OCB designer, do not have to concern yourself with the 
thickness of the plating in a PTH.  In order to allow an electrical 
connection to a PTH, the top and bottom of the PTH is connected to a 
donut shaped conductive region called the annular ring.  The annular 
ring will not be covered in solder mask making it the point where leaded 
components are soldered into the PCB.
When you add a pad to your footprint you can select Diameter and a Drill
size.  The Diameter size is the diameter of the annular ring.  The Drill
size is the diameter of the finished hole. <br><br>

When building a footprint for a device you will need to specify
both the Drill and Diameter (for a pad).  The best case case the
mechanical drawing will provide all the needed information like those
for the SPDT switch you will be building for this week's lab as shown 
in the image below.  

<br><img src="./img/switchFP.bmp"><br><Br>

Before moving on, let's make a few observations.  First, note that
the drill diameter is given by the symbol &psi; (a common convention).
<br>
Second, the dimensions are given in both metric and imperial units, metric 
on top and imperial on the bottom.  For example, the drill diameter is given
as 1.85 and 0.073 inches.  You should be able to figure out that the
units for "1.85" are millimeters because there are 25.4 mm in 1 inch and
0.073 in * (25.4 mm / 1 in) = 1.85 mm. 
<br>
Third, the units of inches are specified as the backeted values on the
bottom of the dimension
pair (a big thumbs up to the engineers who put this together), you 
could easily determine which value is millimeter and inches given the
value pair and the relationship that 25.4mm is 1 inch.  For example, the
vertical distance between the two rows of holes is given as 12.7 or 
0.5 inches.  If the "inches" was missing all I would do is try to 
convert the values into one another.
<pre>
	25.4 mm				 1 in
	------ * 12.7 in = 322 mm	------- * 12.7 mm = 0.5 in
	 1 in				25.4 mm

	INCORRECT			CORRECT
</pre>
In some cases, only one set of units is given without any indication
of which type they are.  In these cases, you will have to use your
deductive reasoning skills and looks for clues like use of a comma 
for a decimal point (europeans use this convention and metric units),
or measurements like 25.4 or 12.7 (corresponding to 0.1 or 0.05 inches).
<br><br>

If the recomended footpring is not given in the mechanical drawing,
the next best case is when the dimensions of the leads as provided like
they are in the LT3080 mechanical drawing below.
<br><img src="./img/lt3080FP.bmp"><br><Br>

I typically make the dill size 10 - 20% larger than the average size
of the lead that is being placed through it. In the case of the TO-220-5 
package this would be 0.8 mm * 1.2 = 0.96 which I rounded up to 1 mm.
When it comes to the diameter of the annular ring, I like to make them
as large as possible to simplify soldering.
However, in densely packed PCBs you will be encouraged
to keep the annular rings as small as possible so that the PCB can 
accommodate higher part densities.  Note the term "BSC" stands for 
basic spacing between centers and in this case, symonous with pin
pitch.  
<br><br>

A drill hole without conductive  plating is called a "hole" in EAGLE.
In order to better assure that a hole does not make electrical contact
with the copper layers on the top and bottom of the PCB, you should make
sure there is a keepout region (layer 39 or 40) on the top and bottom 
layer of the PCB.  A keepout does just what its name implies, it keeps 
out copper pour.   A keepout should be between 10 - 20% larger that
the diameter of the drill hole.  Like plated through holes, I like to
make drill hole diameters 10 - 20% larger than the size of the object
going through the hole.
<br><br>

Finally SMT pads are provided by EAGLE in order to attached surface mount
devices of the PCB.  These SMT pads have an X and Y dimension that needs
to be slightly larger than the part being placed.  Often the mechanical
drawing section of the technical documents will have a recommended footprint
for SMT devices.  Lacking that, make your SMT pads at least 10% larger
than the electrical contact, with 25% larger being an upper bound.  





<h3>Add the pins</h3>
I captured the image above while I was placing the pad associated with 
pin number 1.  While moving the pad around to get it into position, 
I keep an eye on the cursor location.  All coordinate references are
with respect to the origin, with up and right being positive.  In this
case I would need to move the pad left and up to get it into the correct
position for pad 1.


<ul>	<li>Left mouse click on the pad tool in the leftmost toolbar,
	<li>On the top toolbar, set the pad type to Offset,
	<li>On the top toolbar, set Drill to 1 (millimeter)
	<li>On the top toolbar, set the Diameter to 1.6764,
	<li>To make you life easier, place the pin 1 pad first, and
	the rest of the pad in numerical order,
	<li>If you are unable to get the pin exactly where you want it,
	because of the grid resolution, place it as close as possible
	and we'll fix it in a later step.
</ul>


<h3>Use the information tool</h3>
The information tool makes the properties of a selected item available
to edit by the user.

<ul>	<li>Select the information tool from the left toolbar,
	<li>Select the center of the pad that it not exactly where
	you want it,
	<li>In the Properties pop-up, change the position of the
	pad to its needed position,
	<li>Click OK to complete the change,
	<li>Continue to any other pads that need their positions
	changed.
</ul>

Use the information tool to change the names of all the pads according
to the names you found earlier.  Call the unconnected pin, "NC$1".
The "NC" in the name 
stand for No Connect, the "$1" means that this is the first pin with that
name.  If there was a second non-connected pin in this package, I would 
have named it "NC$2".

<h3>Add the name and value</h3>
The parts that you place on the schematic and place on the PCB need
unique identifiers so that you can place the correct electrical component
in the correct location.  In the schematic, an electrical device like
a resistor has a name (for example "R4") and a value, (for example
"10k&ohms;).  The '>' character before name is a special character that 
lets Eagle know that this value should be dynamically updated by the 
program.  You specify the default location for these two labels
in the package editor using the following instructions.

<ul>	<li>Select layer 25, tNames
	<li>Click on the text tool
	<li>In the Text pop-up, enter ">Name" the in the "Enter text" area,
	<li>Click OK,
	<li>Left mouse click to place text (above the part)
	<li>Press escape,
	<li>Replace text in "Enter text" area with ">Value",
	<li>Click OK,
	<li>Select layer 27, tValues
	<li>Left mouse click to place text (above/right the part),
	<li>Press escape twice to exit from the text tool.
</ul>

When you complete this step, you should have a package that looks 
like the following image.

<br><img src="./img/finishedPackage.bmp"><br><br>

<h3>Save</h3>

<ul>	<li>File &rarr; Save
	<li>In the Save as pop-up, click on your library
	<li>Click Save,
	<li>In the Warning pop-up click OK to overwrite the (empty) library.
</ul>


<h3>Create a new Symbol</h3>

The symbol is what you see in the schematic when a part is placed.

<ul>	<li>Library &rarr; Manage symbols&hellip;
	<li>In the Edit pop-up enter LT3080 in the "New Symbol Name" field,
	<li>Click OK
	<li>Click Yes in the Warning pop-up to create a new symbol.
</ul>

You will now enter the symbol editor. This is a basically a drawing 
application with special features for PCB design. You are going to draw 
the LT3080's schematic symbol. To do this, you will use several tools 
pointed-out in the following image. 

<br><img src="./img/symbEdit.bmp"><br><br>


<h3>Draw the symbol</h3>

<ul>	<li>Select the line tool,
	<li>Make sure that layer 94 Symbol is selected
	<li>Use the line tool to draw a rectangle with 
	vertices at:<br>
	(-0.4, 0.2) - (0.4, 0.2) - (0.4, -0.2) - (-0.4,-0.2)
	<li>Select the Pin tool,
	<li>Put two pins on the left side of the rectangle,
	<li>Put a pin on the bottom, rotating the pin using
	the right mouse click,
	<li>Put a pin on the right side of the rectangle,
	rotating with a right mouse click as needed,
	<li>Press escape to exit the Pin tool.
</ul>

Now its time to add the name and value as we did in the package 
design.

<ul>	<li>Select the Text tool,
	<li>In the Text pop-up, enter ">Name" in the "Enter text" box,
	<li>Click OK,
	<li>Place the text near the upper left corner of the symbol
	by left mouse clicking,
	<li>Press escape,
	<li>Enter ">Value" in the "Enter text" box,
	<li>Place the text near the upper right corner of the symbol
	by left mouse clicking,
	<li>Press escape twice to exit.
</ul>

Now we need to correct some of the properties of the pins.  Before you
start, make sure that your symbol looks sometime like the following:

<br><img src="./img/symbRaw.bmp"><br><br>

<ul>	<li>Select the Information tool,
	<li>Click on the upper left pin (labeled "P$1" in the image
	above),
	<li>In the Properties pop-up make the following changes,
	<ul>	<li>Name: 	IN
		<li>Direction:	pwr	</ul>
	<li>Click OK
	<li>Change P$2 to VCTL, pwr
	<li>Change P$3 to SET, in
	<li>Change P$4 to OUT, pwr
</ul>

Save before taking the last step, making a device.

<h3>Create Device</h3>

<ul>	<li>Library &rarr; Manage devices&hellip;
	<li>Enter "LT3080" in the "New Device Name" text box,
	<li>Click OK,
	<li>Click Yes in the Warning pop-up to create a new device,
</ul>

You will now use the device editor to merge the package and the symbol
created for the LT3080.  The interface you will use to accomplish this
uses several specialized tools highlighted in the image below.

<br><img src="./img/devEdit.bmp"><br><Br>	


<ul>	<li>Click the Add tool in the left toolbar,
	<li>In the Add pop-up, select the LT3080 Symbol,
	<li>Click OK,
	<li>Your cursor will change to the symbol for the LT3080.
	Place the center of the symbol over the center of the
