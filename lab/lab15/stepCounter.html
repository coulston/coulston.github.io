<h1>Step Counter</h1>
</center>
<br>

The objective of this experiment is to calculate the number of steps that you have
taken as a proxy to the distance you have walked.
<br><Br>

Configure the Lab 15 firware to record the acceleration. Attached the development 
board/daughter board combo to your person, start logging data and walk or run a known
distance - perhaps once around a track.
<br><br>

Stop logging the data and then spool it to a file.  You can import the file in Excel
or into Matlab (using a command like
<font face="courier">noiseData = importdata("rawDataFromPutty.csv");</font>).  Plot
the data to produce something like the image below.

<br><img src="./img/experiments/stepCount.JPG"><br><br>

You will need to write a function (in excel, Matlab or a programming language) that 
uses this data to count the number of steps taken.  Multiple this by your stride
length to estimate the distance you traveled and compare it against the actual distance
you traveled.
