<h3>Inversense MPU6050</h3>
The Inversense MPU6050  contains a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis
gyroscope.  Meaning that this device can measure accelerations 
along 3 perpendicular axis and can measure the rate of rotation
along 3 perpendicular axis.

To understand the bits being sent back and forth between the MPU-6050
and the PIC, connect the oscilloscope to the GY-521 board  according 
to the following table.

&gt; There should be a picture here to help guide students &lt;
