<h1>Vibration analysis</h1>
</center>
<br>


The goal of this experiment is to characterize the vibrations in a beam.  To do this
you will need to create a setup to hold a flexible beam in place with the development
board placed at the end.  In the example photographed below, 3 plastic rulers form the
beam, a pair of clamps holds the beam in place, and the development is held in place
with rubber bands.

The advantage of using a ruler as the beam is that it comes pre-made with a scale 
attached, handy for the second component of this task.  Once you have everything
in place, pluck the end of the ruler, causing the development board to oscillate
up and down, and record 512 samples acceleration samples.  Cut and paste these
samples into excel and plot them.  In the example below, the ruler hung over the 
edge of my desk by 20 cm and I was recording samples every 5 ms.

From the sampling rate, you can determine the frequency of the oscillation. 
Repeat this experiment for different overhang distance and record the frequency
of oscillation for each.  Make a graph of the overhand distance vs. oscillation 
frequency.<br><br>

<b>Optional - Frequency Domain Modeling</b>
Use the information that you learned in EENG 307 to create a mechanical transnational
model for the system with force as the input and the position of the accelerometer
as the output.  Use this model to get the transfer function Xout/Fin.  Import this
information into Matlab and use the impulse function to to simulate plucking the
end of the ruler.  Plot the output position vs time.  Measure the mass of the 
development board and then adjust the damping and spring constants so that the 
Matlab plot agrees with the ruler at one of its positions. The relevant portion 
of Matlab code is shown below.
