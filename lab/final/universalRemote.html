<h2>Proposal</h2>
Remote controls are ubiquitous in the moder household, controlling
a variety of household electronics.  For a variety of reasons it may
be necessary to clone the functions produced by a remote control.
Such devices are called Universal Remote controls because they can 
be taught the button presses of a donor remote and reproduce these button
presses on the Universal Remote.
<br><Br>

<b>Remote Control Basics</b><Br>
The signal output of the remote control decoder is nominally logic 1,
meaning that when there is no IR activity the IR remote control decoder
module outputs logic 1. When a button on a remote control is pressed,
the remote control sends out a sequence of bits consisting of:
<ul>	<li>one start bit,
	<li>a set of data bits and,
	<li>half a stop bit.
</ul>
The bits consists of two "half bits", a logic 0 pulse and a logic 1 pulse.
The duration of the two half bits determines the identity of the complete
bit. For example,the start bit has a logic 0 pulse around 8 ms (called
startLow in Figure 1) and a logic 1 pulse duration of about 4 ms (called
start High in Figure 1). The start and stop bit are put into the
remote control data packet to frame the data bits.  The individual data
bits likewise consist of two half bits.
<br><br>

<br><img src="./img_urc/bitPacket.bmp"><br>
<b>Figure 1: Left, a typical IR waveform. The 32 data bits, labeled
D1 &hellip; D32, are detailed at right.  Right, the names of the 
two half bits for a 0-bit (dataZero) and 1-bit (dataOne).</b>
<br><br>

On many remote controls, all the data bits have the same logic 0 half-bit
duration (dataZeroLow and dataOneLow in Figure 1), of about 800 &micro;s. 
It's the duration of the logic 1 half-bit that determines the value of the 
data bit.  A data bit with value 0 will have a high half-bit duration of 
around 800 &micro;s, labeled "dataZeroHigh" in Figue 1. A data bit with 
value 1 will have a high half-bit duration of around 1,600 &micro;s, 
labeled "dataOneHigh" in Figure 1. 
<br><br>

If you are using this as your final project starting point, then you
should make the following assumptions about your IR data packet.  Most
IR waveforms for TVs are similar to that shown in Figure 1.  Part of 
your project will involve verifying this structure.  You will do this
by writing code to "draw" the IR waveform.

<ul><li>The IR waveform look like the "IR data
packet" shown in the image below.  The names for the start, data, and stop
intervals are provided,
<li>The IR data packet has 32 or fewer data bits. You need to verify this
with your chosen remote and get a different one is this is not the case.
<li>There are only two different types of data bits.  The data bits
D1, D2 &hellip; D32 drawn as single blocks in the IR data packet when
each consist of two half bits shown in detail at right,
<li>The dataZeroLow and dataOneLow durations are the same,
<li>There is at least 25ms pause between IR data packets,
<li>Choose a prescaler for the timer will not roll over when measuring
any single duration in the IR data packet.
</ul>

Note that the number of low intervals is one more than
the number of high intervals because there is no stopHigh bit.



The goal of this project is to build a Universal Remote control using
the IR decoder and IR transmitter on the PIC development board that
produces waveforms similar to those shown in Figure 1.



<h2>Level-0</h2>
Figure 2 shows the Level-0 diagram of the Universal Remote control (URC).  
This figure shows that the donor remote control IR waveforms is the main
input and the system that we will develop will generate the cloned
IR waveform.

This version of the URC a prototype to demonstrate the proof of concept.  
As a result, where-as a final product would have function specific buttons 
for tasks, our URC will use a Putty terminal to configure the function of
the URC.

The top of the menu shows the status of the donor remote control as
determined by the "c" and "t" commands (more on them later). The name
"startLow" is a reference to duration (in &micro;s) of the first IR
waveform half-bit shown in Figure 1 and will be replaced by a numerical
value corresponding to the duration of this half bit.

<dd> This function determines the duration of all the different bits in 
the IR data packet.  It will do this by using the number of edges 
determined by the "c" function to correctly gather the correct number of 
pulse durations.  Our code may print out the duration of the time low 
half-bits, followed by the time high half-bits.  Then our code will 
determine the 7 different durations in the IR data packet (startLow, 
startHigh, dataOneLow, dataZeroLow, dataOneHigh, dataZeroHigh, stopLow).
</dd>

<dt>d - decode (Implement to increase technical difficulty)</dt>
<dd>
Using the 7 values found using the "t" function, decode the data
bits of the IR data packet as a 32-bit integer with the most significant
bit being D1.  This function will prompt the user to press a remote
control button and then output a single 32-bit value (in hex).  
</dd>

<dt>l - learn</dt>
<dd>
With all the characteristics of the IR data packet understood by our
algorithm, this function will clone some remote control buttons.  Our algorithm
will prompt the user to press a remote control button.  Our algorithm will then
decode this button into its 32-bit code and store this 32-bit code in an array.
This donor remote control button will be reproduced using the "1" command
discussed next.  This process will be repeated by our algorithm for three more 
donor remote control buttons.  Each successive donor remote control button
is reproduced by an incremented command as discussed next.
</dd>

<dt>1, 2, 3, 4</dt>
<dd>
Pressing the numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4 should produce an IR waveform that
corresponds to the code and durations for that cloned donor remote control
button.
</dd>

<h2>Level-1</h2>
Figure 3 shows the level 1 diagram.  This representation of the URC
shows the GP1UW70 IR decoder converting the donor remote IR waveform
into an electrical signal.  This signal is sent to the RC4 pin on the
PIC, but we plan to jumper RC4 and another pin (you will have to 
determine which) so that we can use one of the PICs built-in 
subsystem to help decode the duration of the half-bits in the 
incoming waveform.

<br><img src="./img_urc/level1.bmp"><br>
<b>Figure 3: Level 1 diagram of the Universal Remote control.</b>
<br><br>

The built-in 2N222 BJT will amplify the PIC PWM signal into a
transmitted IR waveform.  The FT230X chip performs familiar duties;
providing a USB to serial bridge and voltage regulation of the 5V
USB power.

<h2>Technical Difficulty</h2>
There are a variety of design decisions that you will have to make
on your way to completing this project.  Many of these decisions 
will effect the technical complexity of the project.  I've listed
some of these below:<br><Br>

<b>How have you captured the IR waveform?</b>
<ul>	<li>Low: In main polling the IR pin
	<li>Using a TMR ISR to periodically sample the IR pin
	<li>Using an interrupt on change on the IR pin
	<li>High: Using a capture interrupt on the IR pin
</ul>

<b>How are you going to represent the IR waveform?</b>
<ul>	<li>Low: Array of TMR counts for each bit
	<li>High: Compute period of each bit type then store
	each donor button as 32-bit value
</ul>

<b>How are you going to generate the IR waveform?</b>
<ul>	<li>Low: In main by polling TMR flags of IR PWM pin
	<li>Using an interrupt to change the IR PWM pin
	<li>High: Using a compare interrupt to change the IR PWM pin
</ul>

<b>Will you incorporate advanced functionality?</b>
<ul>	<li>Low: Just learn four button presses
	<li>Medium: Play back a sequence of donor remote button presses
	<li>High:???
</ul>


<h2>Milestone #1</h2>
The first milestone will focus on learning the characteristics of the
specific donor remote that we are using.

We will closely examine the codes, looking for patterns.  For example, the 
RC5 standard breaks the 32 data bits into different fields.  Some remotes
break the data packet into two halves and make all the bits in the second
half the negation of the first 16-bits. This enables a level of error
detection on the receiver's end.
