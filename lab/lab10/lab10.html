<h2>InLab 10</h2>
Some self guided <a href="./inlab10.html">activities.</a>

<h2>Lab 10 assignment</h2>
Create an embedded system that plays an audio recording stored on an SD
Card.  You program should store either a pure sine wave or an audio
recording from a microphone sampled at a user adjustable rate (default
to 100&micro;s).

<h2>Software</h2>
At start-up your program should present a splash screen - this would
be a great place for some ascii art. The splash screen should also contain
connection instruction for the development board; for this assignment tell
the user there are no jumpers to install! When you press "?" at the
terminal you should be greeted with the following menu.

<pre>
-------------------------------------------------
    Play length in blocks: 0
    sdCardAddress: 0000:0000
    sample rate: 100us
-------------------------------------------------
?: help menu
o: k
Z: Reset processor
z: Clear the terminal
-------------------------------------------------
i: Initialize SD card
-------------------------------------------------
a/A: decrease/increase read address
r: read a block of 512 bytes from SD card
1: write perfect 26 value sine wave to 128 blocks
-------------------------------------------------
s: spool memory to a csv file
-------------------------------------------------
+/-: Increase/Decrease the sample rate by 10 us
P: Play from SD card to PWM -> LPF -> Audio
W: Write microphone => SD card 
-------------------------------------------------
</pre>

The header of the help menu should display the following status information
about the record/playback system.
<ul>	<li>Play length in blocks is set by the "1" or "W" functions.
	Whenever either of these functions is run, you need to keep
	track of the number of blocks written to the SD card in order 
	to playback the correct number of blocks.  This does not need
	to be a global variable.
	<li>sdCardAddress is the address used by the "r" and "+" or "-"
	functions.  I find these functions super useful when debugging
	what I have written into memory.  The "1", "W" and "P" functions
	should have their own address variable and NOT change this 
	address.
	<li>sample rate is the TMR0 interrupt frequency. Both the
	record and playback utilize the TMR0 ISR.  If you change the
	sample rate between recording and playback you will change the 
	pitch of the sound recorded - this can be fun.  Display the
	sample rate in microseconds by dividing the timer counts by
	an appropriate constant.
</ul>
	
The menu system has the following functions:

<ul>
<li><b>?</b><br>
Prints out the ever useful help menu.  Display the current upper and
lower audio thresholds as part of the menu.
<br><br>

<li><b>Z</b><br>
Reset the processor so that we can see that splash screen.
<br><br>

<li><b>z</b><br>
Clear the terminal using a bunch of new lines.
<br><br>

<li><b>i</b><br>
Initialize the SD Card using the routines given in the inLab code.
<br><Br>

<li><b>a/A</b><br>
decrement or increment the address used to read the memory.  This is
also a cut-and-paste from the inlab code.
<br><br>

<li><b>r</b><br>
This should read a block from the SD Card and display it to the terminal
just as was done in the inLab code - just cut-and-paste
<br><br>


<li><b>1</b><br>
In order to test next weeks program, it will be very helpful to have
a known waveform stored in the SD Card.  Let's do future you a favor
and take care of this now.  Copy the following sine wave 
over and over again in the SD Card.  You need to copy the wave
"smoothly" across block boundaries.  In other words, when your code runs
out of room in one block at sin[index], the first value stored in the 
next block should be sin[index+1], NOT sin[0].  Continue storing sine
waves until the user presses any key.  After a keypress, tell the user
how many blocks have been stored.

<pre>
const uint8_t   sin[SINE_WAVE_ARRAY_LENGTH] = {128,	159,	187,	213,	233,	248,	255,	255,	248,	233,	213,	187,	159,	128,	97,	69,	43,	23,	8,	1,	1,	8,	23,	43,	69,	97};
</pre>

<li><b>s</b><br>
Spool block of data off the SD Card to the terminal.  Before you start 
spooling, you will configure PuTTY to store anything that appears on
the terminal into a file.  You will then spool blocks of the SD Card
to the terminal.  Finally you will instruct PuTTY to close
the file.  
<br><br>


<li><b>+/-</b><br>
Change SAMPLE_RATE from a #define to a global variable sampleRate. 
Initialize the sampleRate to generate an interrupt every 100&micro;s.
Allow the '+' function the increase the sampleRate by 10&micro;s and
the '-' function the decrease the sampleRate by 10&micro;s.  Do not
allow the sampleRate to go below 20&micro;s. 
<br><br>

<li><b>P</b><br>
Play back the audio samples stored in the SD Card.  To do this main
sets a flag that causes the TMR0 ISR to pull audio samples from either
the red or blue buffers.  This buffer value is then used as the PWM
duty cycle (via EPWM1_LoadDutyValue).  This PWM output on RC2 is then
sent to the LPF (make sure the jumper is installed) whoses output 
is sent to the amplifier (make sure the jumper is installed).  If
the speaker is installed, this should generate an audio output.
<br><br>
The ISR needs to keep track of where it is in the red or blue buffer
and alert main (via a global variable) when the buffer is empty.  
Main needs to load the red and blue buffers with data as the ISR needs
them.  Main read the SD Card using the SDCARD_ReadBlock command provided
to you in a previous lab.  The audio level of the voice recordings will 
be pretty low, so make sure to listen to the recordings in a silent room.
The audio output of the stored sinusoid is resonablly loud, so much so
that you will want to make sure the jumper adjacent to the USB connector
is installed because the speaker may draw enough current to brown-out the
PIC causing the PIC to reset.
<Br><br>


<li><b>W</b><br>
This will record the microphone values converted through the ADC into the
SD Card at the sampling rate (default to 100 us).  When the user types 
'W' in the terminal window, prompt with user with
<font face="courier">Press any key to start recording audio and
press  any key to stop recording.</font>.  
This will allow the user to get all set-up without having to pay attention
to which key they press in order to start the audio recording.  
<br><br>

Your program must use double buffering so that it can acquire new samples
while storing old samples.  To do this you will use the TMR0 ISR to 
collected converted values from the ADC and start a new conversion.
In addition, the TMR0
ISR is responsible for moving the sampled value into either the red
or blue buffer (both global variables because of their size), and set 
flags true to indicate when either buffer is full.  Main should be 
monitoring these flags and writing the red or blue buffer to the SD
Card when either is full.  While main is doing this, the ISR should be
storing microphone samples to the other buffer.

to record predictable waveforms.


<h3>If you didn't get the previous lab working?</h3>
If you did not get the previous lab working, you can
still complete this lab by recording your audio in the 
foreground instead of sampling them in myTMR0ISR interrupt.  
Do this by:
<ul>	<li>Replacing your record function with the following code
	<li>Delete all the record code from your myTMR0ISR.
	<li>Add TMR1 with a 1:1 prescaler, <u>Make sure to set
	TMR1H = 0x00 and TMR0L = 0x00 in the Register configuration
	of TMR1 when you use MCC!!!</u>
</ul>

This code will record audio onto your SD card.  Now you can focus on
writing the the myTMR0ISR to playback the stored recording.

Before main declare:
<pre>
#define BLOCK_SIZE              512

typedef enum {
    BEING_EMPTIED, EMPTY
} myBufferState_t;

typedef struct {
    myBufferState_t state;
    uint8_t buffer[BLOCK_SIZE];
} sdCardBlock_t;

sdCardBlock_t redBuffer, blueBuffer, silence;
</pre>

Then inside main use:

<pre>

                    //--------------------------------------------
                    // R: Record microphone store on SD card
                    //--------------------------------------------
                case 'R':
                    printf("Press any key to start recording of audio\r\n");
                    while (EUSART1_DataReady == false);
                    (void) EUSART1_Read();

                    loopSDcardAddress = 0;
                    //Added TMR1 with 1:1 prescaler and no interrupts to 
                    // create the needed delays.

                    uint16_t redIndex = 0;
                    uint16_t blueIndex = 0;
                    printf("Press any key to stop recording of audio\r\n");
                    TMR1_WriteTimer(0x0000);
                    while (EUSART1_DataReady == false) {

                        for (redIndex = 0; redIndex < BLOCK_SIZE; redIndex++) {
                            ADCON0bits.GO_NOT_DONE = 1;
                            TMR1_WriteTimer(0x10000 - sampleRate + TMR1_ReadTimer());
                            PIR1bits.TMR1IF = 0;
                            while (!TMR1_HasOverflowOccured());
                            redBuffer.buffer[redIndex] = ADRESH;
                        }

                        SDCARD_WriteBlock(loopSDcardAddress, redBuffer.buffer);
                        while ((status = SDCARD_PollWriteComplete()) == WRITE_NOT_COMPLETE);
                        loopSDcardAddress += BLOCK_SIZE;

                        for (blueIndex = 0; blueIndex < BLOCK_SIZE; blueIndex++) {
                            TMR1_WriteTimer(0x10000 - sampleRate + TMR1_ReadTimer());
                            PIR1bits.TMR1IF = 0;
                            while (!TMR1_HasOverflowOccured());
                            blueBuffer.buffer[blueIndex] = ADRESH;
                        }

                        SDCARD_WriteBlock(loopSDcardAddress, blueBuffer.buffer);
                        while ((status = SDCARD_PollWriteComplete()) == WRITE_NOT_COMPLETE);
                        loopSDcardAddress += BLOCK_SIZE;
                    }
                    (void) EUSART1_Read();
                    playLengthInBlocks = loopSDcardAddress >> LOG_BLOCK_SIZE;
                    printf("Just wrote %d blocks to SD card, each page filled with audio data.\r\n", playLengthInBlocks);
                    break;

</pre>

<h3>Volume hack</h3>
When you get the playback and record system to function correctly,
you will no doubt notice that the playback volume is very low.  This
is due in part to the low corner frequency of the output low pass
filter and the low gain of the output amplifier.  I provided you
a means to increase the volume of the output by connecting the two
pads on the solder jumper labeled "volume" shown in the image below.  
To do this, grab a piece of solder, heat up a solder iron and add solder 
to the two pads until you intentionally create a solder bridge between
the two pads.

<img src="./img/increaseVolume.jpg"><br><br>

Note, that the down-side to this modification is that it will also
increase the volume level of the already loud square-wave output.
This may cause the development board to brown-out.
