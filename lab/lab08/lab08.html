<h2>InLab 8</h2>
Some self guided <a href="./inlab08.html">activities.</a>

<h2>Lab 8 assignment</h2>
Write a program that determines the frequency of a sin wave audio input
provided by a whistle or audio function generator (like Keuwlsoft
Dual Channel Function Generator for Android or Tone Generator Audio
Frequency for iPhone).  In order to ensure that you have usable data,
your algorithm will wait until the sound level measured by the microphone
exceeds a upper or lower sound threshold level as shown in the following
image. 

<br><img src="./img/audioSampling.bmp"><br><br>

When enabled, the ISR will have the responsibility to:
<ul>	<li>Determine if the ambient sound level exceeds 
	either the upper or lower threshold,
	<li>When this happens to fill a 512 byte buffer with audio samples 
	collected from the microphone.  These samples will be collected 
	every 25&micro;s.  The buffer will be 512 bytes long - be careful
	with the data type of your counting variables (uint8_t can only
	count up to 256, not 512).
	<li>When the buffer is full, set a flag true alerting main that
	the buffer is full.
</ul>

Main will be polling this flag and when it is true will go
on to determine the period of the waveform as follows.<Br><br>

<ul>
<li>Have main scan the buffer, that was filled by the ISR, to determine 
indicies where the microphone samples increased past the value of 128.
In other words, look for array indicies where buffer[index] &le; 128 and 
buffer[index + 1] &gt; 128.  We will call these positive edge crossing
because the microphone values are increasing through a threshold value, 128.
<li>Store all these positive edge crossing indicies into an array.
<li>Have main determine the number of indicies between adjacent positive 
edge zero crossing. 
<li>Compute the average of all the periods collected and then print 
the average and, from this information, the frequency.  There will be
some further discussion below about how to do this so that you can
extract the maximum amount of information from the data you have.
</ul>

Since the microphone was sampled every 25&micro;s by the ISR, the average
number of indicies between consecutive positive edge crossing times 
25&micro;s, is equal to the period.   You will represent your answer in
microseconds, this will allow you to perform all your math using integers.
<br><br>

If you are having issues where the compiler complains that the PIC
is "out of memory", move your large arrays out of main and make them
global.  Also, you do NOT need to make the zero crossing array have
512 entries. You should assume that someone whistling will produce a
sine wave about 1.8kHz. In the example presented below, this creates
10 zero crossing.  Doubling this value should be more than enough 
zero crossing for any realistic whistle.
<br><br>

<b>ISR Details</b><br>
Write the ISR to operate as a state machine using the following state
diagram.
<br><img src="./img/isrFSM.bmp"><br><br>

Use an enumerated type to define the states.  You could use something
like the following declaration.
<pre>
typedef enum  {MIC_IDLE, MIC_WAIT_FOR_TRIGGER, MIC_ACQUIRE} myTMR0states_t;
</pre>
The ISR should use the switch/case structure to move between states.
Your ISR will need several static variable to keep track of the state
and the buffer index.
<br><br>

When you first get your program working, you will notice that your program
reports the waveform periods lower than the input period. I will focus on
period in this discussion because you will use the period information to 
fix this problem.  For example, my program reports that a waveform with 
period 2500 &micro;s (400 Hz) has a period of 2037 &micro;s. This is 
difference of 463 &micro;s represents time spent in the ISR.  I want you to 
compensate for this time spent in the ISR by adjusting the initial count 
value of the TMR0 ISR by a fudge factor.  The factor is not 463 &micro;s,
because this amount of time was distributed across the number of ISR calls
made during one period of the input waveform.  You should be able to 
calculate exact how many timer counts to include in your fudge factor.
When you get it right, your program should be able to get within 50Hz of 
the true waveform.
<br><br>

At start-up your program should present a splash screen - this would
be a great place for some ASCII art. The splash screen should also contain
connection instruction for the development board; for this assignment tell the 
user there are no jumpers to install! When you press "?" at the terminal 
you should be greeted with the following menu.
<pre>
------------------------------
?: Help menu
o: k
Z: Reset processor
z: Clear the terminal
T/t: Increase/decrease threshold 138 - 118
f: gather 512 samples from the microphone and calculate the frequency
------------------------------
</pre>

<ul>
<li><b>?</b><br>
Prints out the ever useful help menu.  Display the current upper and
lower audio thresholds as part of the menu.
<br><br>

<li><b>z</b><br>
Clear the terminal using a bunch of new lines.
<br><br>

<li><b>z</b><br>
Reset the processor so that we can see that splash screen.
<br><br>

<li><b>T</b>
Increase the upper threshold by 5 and decrease the lower threshold by
5.  This allows you to decrease the sensitivity of the microphone to
ambient noise and requires a stronger audio input to trigger the 
frequency measurement procedure.  
At program start-up set the initial upper threshold to 128 + 10.
At program start-up set the initial lower threshold to 128 - 10.
<br><br>

<li><b>t</b>
Decrease the upper threshold by 5 and increase the lower threshold by
5.  This allows you to increase the sensitivity of the microphone to
ambient noise and requires a weaker audio input to trigger the 
frequency measurement procedure.
At program start-up set the initial upper threshold to 128 + 10.
At program start-up set the initial lower threshold to 128 - 10.
<br><br>

<li><b>f</b>
Calculate the frequency of audio waveform using the procedure
discussed above.  Provide the following diagnostic information
as you work your way through the process.  In order to reduce the
amount of text, I changed the NUMBER_OF_MICROPHONE_SAMPLES_TO_COLLECT
define in my program to 256. My program was designed to run with this
define set to 512.  You may want to write your program with a define
like this - for initial testing set the define small (like 64) and then 
later increase the define to 512.

<pre>
The last 256 ADC samples from the microphone are:

The sound wave crossed at the following indicies
17 40 62 85 107 130 153 175 198 220 243

The sound wave had 10 periods
40 - 17 = 23
62 - 40 = 22
85 - 62 = 23
107 - 85 = 22
130 - 107 = 23
153 - 130 = 23
175 - 153 = 22
198 - 175 = 23
220 - 198 = 22
243 - 220 = 23

average period = 565 us
average frequency = 1769 Hz
</pre>

A "crossing" occurs when a microphone sample is less than or equal to 128 
and the next microphone sample is above 128.  The list of numbers below the 
text "The sound wave crossed &hellip;" are the indicies of the crossing 
values.  For example, the 17th ADC value (remember to index from 0) is 114
and the 12th value is 145.  Thus, 17 is stored (in an array) as a
crossing point.  You need to store all such crossing points in an array  - 
this is the list 17 40 62 85 107 130 153 175 198 220 243.  Associated with
this, you will also need to have a variable that stores the number of 
crossings - in this case 11.  The number of indicies between two consecutive 
crossings is the period of the waveform (in units of the sampling frequency).
<br><br>

Now, this brings us back to the last billeted point in the list of items
that main is responsible for.  In order to best utilize the information that
you have, you should compute the average period and frequency as follows.
<ul>	<li>Loop through the crossing point array,
	<li>For each index, compute the number of indicies between 
	adjacent crossing. This is done in the example above as the list
	<pre>
	40 - 17 = 23
	62 - 40 = 22
	85 - 62 = 23
	107 - 85 = 22
	130 - 107 = 23
	153 - 130 = 23
	175 - 153 = 22
	198 - 175 = 23
	220 - 198 = 22
	243 - 220 = 23
	</pre>
	<li>Compute the sum of all these differences.  Using the data above
	this is 23 + 22 + 23 + 22 + 23 + 23 + 22 + 23 + 22 + 23 = 226
	<li>Since the period is being measured in terms of sample and there
	are 25 &micro;s per sample, the period (in &micro;s) is just the 
	period in samples time 25.  So, the average period (in &micro;s) 
	as the sum * 25 / &lt;NUMBER_OF_ZERO_CROSSINGS - 1&gt;.  Using the 
	data above, this is 226*25/10 = 526.  Now this is the most
	important point in this discussion, <u>perform the multiplication
	in the numerator before performing the division!</u>  Why?
	<br><br>
	Consider the
	data in our example; if you performed an integer divided 25 by 10
	you would get either 2 or 3 depending on how the division is 
	rounded, either way you would loose the fraction, 0.5 in this case.
	You answer, would be about 25% off from the correct value.  Now
	if you perform the multiplication first you are dividing a reasonably
	large number by 10, reducing the impact of any rounding error.

	<li>Determine the frequency by taking the reciprocal of the 
	period.  Since your period is in terms of &micro;s, you will need
	to introduce a factor of 1,000,000 into this express to get a 
	frequency in terms of Hz.
</ul>

<h3>Turn-in</h3>
You may work with a single partner (or alone) to complete this lab.
Submit your main.c file on Canvas using the instructions posted
there.  You should take note of the Rubric that will be used to evaluate
your assignment. Please form a group before submitting using the
instructions posted on Canvas. You will demonstrate your code at the
beginning of lab.
<br><br>

Your program will be tested using waveforms between 400Hz and 6kHz.
My program was able to get within 1% of the actual frequency. Your
program will be considered to be working correctly if it is within 
2% of the test frequencies.  Spend some time tuning that interrupt frequency!

<h3>Soldering for next week's lab</h3>

Next week's lab will use the SD card.  You should have your SD card
holder in your parts bag.  You will be provided with a SD card next
week.  Note, the software I will provide you with will only work with 
2GB or smaller SD cards - SD HC and SD XC cards will not work with 
the software I will provide you with.
<br><Br>

I would advise you to use solder paste and the soldering iron to complete
this soldering task. To do this, apply a normal amount of solder paste 
on the pads, position the SD card holder on the pads just like you did
when you use the reflow skillet.  However, instead of putting the 
development board on the skillet, you will use the soldering iron to
"reflow" the solder paste.  The soldering iron will reflow the solder
paste in a second or two.  Make sure to heat the solder blob long enough
so that the solder completely attaches to the solder pad on the development
board and the pin of the SD card holder.  2 of the solder locations are 
tabs directly attached to the SD card holder's metal frame.  Consequently, 
these locations are going to require more heat pumped into them to get a 
good connection.  Apply enough heat to get a good connection then stop.
<br><Br>

Solder the SD card holder to the bottom of the development board in 10 
locations.  8 of these locations are the pins of the SD card holder and 
2 of these locations are the frame of of the SD card holder (one on the 
left side and one on the right side).
