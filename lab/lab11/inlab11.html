Lab 11 - In-lab activities</center>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two, read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions prescribed. You do not need to document bullet items. Make a record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy as your teams solution on Canvas using the instructions posted there.

Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions. Use complete English sentences when answering questions. If the answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the piece of art. Only include your answers, do not include the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.

<h2>Objective</h2>

<h2>External hardware</h2>
This week's lab will focus on generating sine waves using a digital
to analog converter built from running a PWM waveform (from ECCP1)
through a low pass filter.  This is the same technique that you have
used in previous labs, so there is nothing really much to talk about
here.  Let's move on.

<h2>Internal Subsystem</h2>
We will be using direct digital synthesis (DDS) to generate the 
sine waves.  We will be using a tmr0 delay in our main DDS loop
to time the changes to the phaseIncrement and consequently the 
DC level of the sine wave.  In your assignment, you will need to
move this loop inside a TMR0 interrupt.  Other than the ECCP1
subsystem and its associate TMR2, there is little new that we 
need to discuss in this section.

<h2>Firmware Experiments</h2>
This lab is all about the firmware, so let's dive in by taking a closer
look at the DDS sine wave generated by the inlab code using an 
oscilloscope configure as follows:

Start by connecting a jumper between RC2 and LPF_in.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Ch1 probe		<td>LPF_out
<tr><td>Ch1 ground clip		<td>Dev board ground loop
<tr><td>Ch1 coupling 		<td>AC
<tr><td>Ch1 (scale) 		<td>500mV
<tr><td>Horizontal (scale) 	<td>1 ms
<tr><td>Trigger mode		<td>Auto
<tr><td>Trigger source		<td>1
<tr><td>Trigger slope		<td>&uarr;
<tr><td>Trigger level		<td>0V
<tr><td>Trigger coupling 	<td>HF Reject
</table>

Make sure to:
<ul>	<li>Align Ch 1 on the second lowest reticule,
	<li>Align the horizontal position at the second left-most reticule,
	<li>Clear all menus off the bottom of the screen<br>
	[&uarr;Back]
	<li>[Meas] &rarr; Clear Meas &rarr; Clear All
	<li>[Meas] &rarr; Source &rarr; 1 
	<li>[Meas] &rarr; Type &rarr; Freq &rarr; Add Measurement
	<li>[&uarr; Back]
</ul>


<h3>Program operation</h3>
Lets start by looking through the code and gathering some important
information.
<ol start=1>
<li>Complete the following table by going through the program 
and finding the data types of the following variables.  From
this information determine the fixed point format for each of
the variables.  If the variable is acting like a regular integer
then its fixed point format is "N.0" where N is the number of
whole number bits that are used.  Hint, look for the shift operation.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Variable 	<td>Data type	<td>Fixed piont format
<tr><td>phaseIncrement	<td>uint_8	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>phaseAccumulator<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>index		<td>&nbsp;	<td>4.0
<tr><td>sin[]		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
</table>
</ol>

<h3>Update Rate</h3>

Now we are ready to understand the main DDS loop in the code, 
reproduced for you below.
<pre>
00.	while (EUSART1_DataReady == false) {                    
01.	    phaseAccumulator = phaseAccumulator + phaseIncrement;
02.	    index = phaseAccumulator >> 4;                            
03.	    EPWM1_LoadDutyValue(sin[index]);
04.	    TMR0_WriteTimer(0xFFFF - RATE); 
05.	    INTCONbits.TMR0IF = 0;
06.	    while (TMR0_HasOverflowOccured() == false);
07.	}
</pre>

<ol start=2>
<li>Using the value for RATE given in the #define statement at the top
of the program, calculate the delay generated by the code in lines 04 
05 and 06. Make sure to show the dimensional analysis as part of your 
answer.

<li>Use the value of the delay found in the previous problem along with
the smallest phaseIncrement (remember that a bit i positions to the right 
of the fixed-point decimal point have value 2<sup>-i</sup>) to determine 
the frequency resolution of this DDS configuration.
</ol>

Use the "+" and "-" commands to set the phaseIncrement to 3.  Use "s"
to produce a sine wave and view it on the oscilloscope.  Measure the
frequency of the sine wave using the oscilloscope as already setup.
You may want to use the averaging function to get a cleaner waveform and
improve the accuracy of your measurement.  
<font face="courier">
Acquire &rarr; AcqMode &rarr; Averaging &rarr; #Avgs: 128.
</font>

When you do this you will notice that the waveform updates occur much
more slowly and morph whenever you change the frequency. However, you
will be able to measure incredibly small amplitudes in this mode,

<ol start=4>
<li>Complete the following table by changing the phaseIncrement
In the "Printed frequency
on terminal" column put the value displayed on PuTTY when you press
the "s" key.  In the "Frequency on scope" put the averaged frequency
measured by the oscilloscope.  In the "Hz/phaseIncrement" column
put the ratio of the oscilloscope measured frequency divided by
the phaseIncrement.  Note that this column is the observed frequency 
resolution of the DDS system because it will tell you how many Hz the 
output waveform changes for a LSB change in the phaseIncrement.
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>phaseIncrement	<td>Printed frequency on terminal	<td>Frequency on scope	<td>Hz/phaseIncrement
<tr><td>3		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>5		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>7		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>9		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>13		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>17		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>23		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>27		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>30-ish
</table>
</ol>

<h3>Tune the update rate</h3>
From the previous experiments you saw that the theoretical frequency
resolution was close, but not an exact match for the observed 
frequency resolution.  The discrepancy is a result of the added time
required to perform the computations in the main DDS loop (lines
01-05 in the code snippet above).  However, this bothers me less than
the fact that <u>I want the observed frequency resolution to be related 
to the phase increment by some power of 2.</u>  Huh?<br><br>

In my program, I displayed the frequency of the waveform to the terminal
user using the expression:
<pre>
printf("Generating a %d Hz sine wave\r\n",phaseIncrement<<5);
</pre>

I approximated the displayed frequency by multiplying the phaseIncrement
by an approximation of the frequency resolution, 32 Hz.  Now, you know
that the observed frequency resolution is 30-ish, you could do one of
two things&hellip;<br><br>

At first glance, the easy thing would be to change the print statement:
<pre>
printf("Generating a %d Hz sine wave\r\n",phaseIncrement*30);
</pre>
While this solution is quick and easy to implement, there is another 
approach which will result in less work for the microcontroller.
<br><br>

<ol start=5>
<li>Let's change the update rate (using the RATE constant) so that the 
frequency resolution of our DDS system is <u>exactly 32Hz.</u>  
Do this systematically by setting up a ratio of the actual RATE value
over the observed update rate (reciprocal of the observed frequency 
resolution) and making this ratio equal to the unknown RATE over the 
target update period, reciprocal of 32 Hz).  Show your work in the
form of a ratio.

<li>After changing the update rate, calculate the percentage error of the terminal frequency value by
computing: 
<font face="courier">% error = 100*(terminal frequency - oscilloscope frequency)/oscilloscope frequency</font>
</ol>
In this week's lab, I found that I was able to get a frequency 
resolution of 0.5 Hz.  You will have to use the units factoring to 
determine a close value for the update rate and then tune the value
(using this method) to get the frequency resolution spot on.   It's worth
the effort because it makes converting between phaseIncrement and 
frequency so much easier.

<h3>Sweep calculation</h3>
First off, make sure to turn off the averaging mode from the oscilloscope
before going any further.  
The code for the frequency sweep operates by incrementally increasing
the phaseIncrement through some duration.  In your program, the core-loop
of the frequency sweep function is cut-and-paste from the sine wave
generator function.  Around this core-loop is a loop that holds each
phaseIncrement for a delay given by timer 1.

<ol start=7>
<li>Use the values for START_PHASE, END_PHASE and the delay created
by timer 1 to determine the amount of time that it takes for the 
outer sweep loop to iterate through all the phaseIncrements.  State
your answer using dimensional analysis.  You will need this equation
to complete this week's lab.  If you are struggling to figure out
how to do this, try finding answers to the following questions.
<ul>	<li>How many times does the outer loop need to loop?
	<li>How long does it take the inner loop to loop?
</ul>

<li>Carefully setup your oscilloscope to capture a whole frequency sweep.
Do this by setting:
<ul>	<li>the vertical adjust to 500mV per division and 
	<li>the horizontal adjust to 100ms per division and
	<li>the trigger level to around 100mV above "ground"
	<li>set the trigger horizontal position on the second reticule.
</ul>
Include a screen shot of the sweep as your answer to this question.

<li>Why is the amplitude across the frequency sweep changing?  Explain
how, knowing the starting and ending frequencies, you could predict 
the change in amplitude.  Hint, think about the hardware we are using 
to transform our PWM signal into a smooth sine wave.

<li>What is the measured duration of the frequency sweep from the
oscilloscope?  Compute the percentage error of the theoretical value
using the equation from earlier in this lab.
</ol>

<h3>Math time</h3>
I found that performing the computation to make a  frequency sweep to 
be the most challenging aspect of this week's lab.  Part of that 
difficulty was the multiplication and division, and printing of 
32-bit values.  I hope that these questions point you in the right
direction so that you don't get caught-up fighting with the compiler
like I did.
<br><br>

For the take-home part of the lab, you will need to change the delay
inside the frequency sweep (TMR1) in order to control the time that the 
sweep takes.  In order to calculate the delay for the frequency sweep you will 
need to perform a computation similar to the one given in the "m" command.
The computation results in the number of
timer counts need for each phaseIncrement of the sweep; a 
uint16_t typed variable that is called d16 in the inlab program.
You need to be careful with your code so as to prevent 
unnecessary overflow.  To this end, I have calculated d16
in two different ways.  A paranoid version (that works) where
each uint16_t variable is cast as a uint32_t prior to
performing any computation.  The second version is more casual
and reflects what one might initially be tempted to do when
writing this program.  You will compare the results of these
two computation styles and compare them to an authority to
determine which does a better job.  By a better job, I mean
overflows less frequently.
<br><br>

In order to determine the correctness of your calculations, you
will need an authority.  In our case, you will use the Windows
calculator as the authority that generates the true, valid solution
to our set of calculations.  Launch the windows calculator by having
windows search for it.  Press the Windows key on your keyboard,
type "calc", wait a moment for the search bar to return its top
reference as Calculator, then hit &lt;Enter&gt;.  When the Calculator
launches, click on the 3 short horizontal bars near the upper left 
corner of the Calculator window and select "Programmer".  Click on 
one of the bases, "Hex" for example, to enter numbers in that base.  
As you enter digits, your value will be converted into the other three 
bases.  
<br><br>

<ol start=11>
<li>Complete the following table by programming in the values
for the a16, b16 variables in the assignment statements in
the case 'm' of your inlab program (around lines 168, 169)
and recording the output in the corresponding rows below.
Compare the results by performing the calculation using the 
windows calculator.  If the result generated results in an
overflow, then indicate this in the entry.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>a16	<td>b16 	<td>d16 - paranoid<td>d16-casual<td>Authority
<tr><td>2000	<td>1000	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>2000	<td>200		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>1000	<td>200		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>2000	<td>100		<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>10,000
<tr><td>2000	<td>10		<td>34,464 (overflow) <td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>100	<td>200		<td>&nbsp;	 <td>&nbsp; 	<td>&nbsp;
</table>

<h3>Build a sine LUT</h3>
You are going to need to build a 64 sine-LUT for this week's lab
 While you could do this
with a calculator, I think that using the following procedure in Excel
will save you a lot of time.  I'll walk you through the process in
the following steps:

<ul>	<li>Enter "Index" in cell E5
	<li>Enter "Theta" in cell F5
	<li>Enter "sin" in cell G5
	<li>Enter "255(sin+1)" in cell H5
	<li>Enter "Text" in cell I5
	<li>Enter "uint8_t sin[64]" in cell B2
	<li>Enter "0" in cell E6
	<li>Enter "=E6+1" in cell E7
	<li>Click on cell E7, aim the cursor at the small green square in 
		the lower right corner of the cell, click and hold, drag
		the cursor down to cell E69.  This is called duplicating
		cell E7 down to cell E69.
	<li>Enter "0" in cell F6
	<li>Enter "=F6 + 2*PI()/64" in cell F7
	<li>Duplicate cell F7 down to cell F69 
	<li>Enter "=sin(F6)" in cell cell G6
	<li>Duplicate cell G6 down to cell G69
	
	<li>Enter "=ROUND(255*(G6+1)/2,0)" in cell H6
	<li>Duplicate cell H6 down to cell H69
	<li>Enter =H6&"," into cell I6
	<li>Duplicate cell I6 down to cell I69
	<li>Select the values in cells I6 down to I69
	<li>type CTRL-c or right mouse and select copy
	<li>Right mouse click on cell C2
	<li>Select Paste Special&hellip;
	<li>In the Paste Special pop-up, select the Values and Transpose
		radio buttons
	<li>If all the values are pasted into the single C2 cell,
		then select Data &rarr; Text to Columns and delimit 
		on spaces
	<li>Select the values in B2 to the end of the array
	<li>Copy using CTRL-c
	<li>Paste into main.c in MPlab X
	<li>Make sure that none of your array values is larger than
	255, otherwise you'll get a bad glitch in the middle of your
	sine wave.
</ul>
