<h2>Guidelines for using the Ultrasonic Cleaner</h2>

You can use the Crest Ultrasonic cleaner to remove solder residue
from printed circuit boards.  An ultrasonic cleaner works by using
ultrasound to rapidly agitate a fluid resulting in cavitation.
An object placed in this fluid has its surface scrubbed by the 
agitated fluid and caveatting bubbles.  <br>

It may seem counter-intuitive to 
drop a piece of electronics into a bath of (mostly) water, but as
long as your circuit is not powered and you have not soldered the
microphone on, you will be fine. 
<br><br>

We have a Crest P500 Ultrasonic Cleaner in our lab. The lid comes
off and is mainly used to keep heat in the tank when the cleaner
is not in use.  Inside the tank is a removable wire basket that 
holds the printed circuit boards being cleaned.

<h3>Step #1 - Set temperature</h3>
Once the ultrasonic cleaner is plugged in, you will use the "Select"
button to setup the cleaner.  Since this the ultrasonic cleaner
has a heater, the first thing that you will want to to is set the 
temperature to 50&deg;C.  Do this by pressing the "Select" button until 
the Heater digits are flashing.  Then use the up and down arrows to 
set the temperature to 5-&deg;C.

<h3>Step #2 - Set cleaning time</h3>
Next you will want to set the cleaning time to 2 minutes.  Do this
by pressing the "Select" button until the Sonic digital are flashing.
Then use the up and down arrows to set the time to 2 minutes.

<h3>Step #3 - Preheat tank</h3>
If the fluid (mostly water) in the tank is not already at 50&deg;C,
then you will need to start the process by pressing the "Heater"
button.  The decimal point LED in the two-digit display will flash
to let you know the tank is being actively heated.  The green LED
on the "Heater" button will illuminate green to let you know that
the heater function is enabled.<br>
If the fluid
in the tank was at room temperature, then it will take about 15 
minutes to heat up to the set-point temperature of 50&deg;C.


<h3>Step #4 - Run the cleaner</h3>
Once the tank is at the correct operating temperature, then 
it's time for your board to take the plunge.  Raise the basket
out of the bath, place your board in an "upright" orientation
(when viewed from above), and then lower your board in the bath.

Next, you will run the ultrasonic cleaner for 2 minutes by 
pressing the "Sonic" button.  Both the "Sonic" and "Heater"
green LEDs will illuminate letting you know that you have
both functions enabled.  The tank will make a particular
high-pitched noise and the surface of the water will ripple
while the ultrasonic waves are being applied to the fluid
in the tank.

<h3>Step #5 - Cleaning your board</h3>
I have found that the ultrasonic cleaner works best when you 
reposition your board.  I like to clean by board four time 
(at 2-minutes each), by rotating it 180&deg;, then flipping
it upside-down in two different orientations.  Thus, my boards
spend a total of 8-minutes being cleaned.
<br><br>

After I am satisfied that the board is clean, I take it to the
restroom and rinse it off with clean water.  After this, I let
the board dry completely before plugging it back in.  If you have
access to compressed air, you could give the board a good drying.
